Chapter I
Description of Virtue
(Stla-niddesa)
[I. Introductory]
1. [1]	"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and understanding,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle" (S113).
This was said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at Savatthi,
it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night and in order to do away with his
doubts, he asked this question:
"The inner tangle and the outer tangle~
This generation is entangled in a tangle.
And so I ask of Gotama this question:
Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?" (S113).
2. Here is the meaning in brief. Tangle is a term for the network of craving. For
that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together, like the tangle called network of
branches in bamboo thickets, etc., because it goes on arising again and again up
and down1 among the objects [of consciousness] beginning with what is visible.
But it is called the inner tangle and the outer tangle because it arises [as craving] for
one's own requisites and another's, for one's own person and another's, and for
the mternal and external bases [for consciousness]. Since it arises in this way this
generation is entangled in a tangle. As the bamboos, etc., are entangled by the bamboo
tangle, etc., so too this generation, in other words, this order of living beings, is all
entangled by the tangle of craving~the meaning is that it is intertwined, interlaced
by it. [2] And because it is entangled like this, so I ask of Gotama this question, that is
why I ask this. He addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as Gotama. Who

1. "From a visible datiun sometimes as far down as a mental datmn, or vice versa,
following the order of the six kinds of objects of consciousness as given in the teaching"
(Vism-nilit 5, see XV32).
`64
succeeds in disentangling this tangle: who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the
three kinds of existence entangled in this way?—What he asks is, who is capable of
disentangling it?
3.	However, when questioned thus, the Blessed One, whose knowledge of all
things is unimpeded, deity of deities, excelling Sakka (Ruler of Gods), excelling
Bicduna, fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence, wielder
of the ten powers, all-seer with imobstructed knowledge, uttered this stanza in
reply to explain the meaning:
"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and understanding,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."
4.	My task is now to set out the true sense,
Divided into virtue and the rest,
Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage.
There are here in the Victor's Dispensation
Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,
And who although desiring purity
Have no right knowledge of the siue straight way
Comprising virtue and the other two,
Right hard to find, that leads to pmity——~
Who, though they strive, here gain no purity.
To tliem I shall expoimd the conifortiiig Path
Of Purification, pure in expositions,
Relying on the teaching of the dwellers
In the Great Monastery;2 let all those
Good men who do desire piuity
Listen intently to my exposition.
5.	Herein purification should be understood as Nibbana, which being devoid of
all stains, is utterly pure. The path of purification is the path to that purification; it is
the means of approach that is called the path. The meaning is, I shall expound that
path of piuification.
6.	In some instances this path of pm ification is taught by insight alone,3 according
as it is said:
2.	The Great Monastery (Maliaviliara) at Aniuadhapiaa in Sri Laiika.
3.	"The words 'insight alone' are meant to exclude not virtue, etc., but serenity (i.e.
jhtitia), which is the opposite niunber in the pair, serenity and insight. This is for
emphasis. But the word 'alone' actually excludes only that concentration with distinction
[of jhana]; for concentration is classed as both access and absorption (see IV32). Taking
this stanza as the teaching for one whose vehicle is insight does not imply that there is
no concentration; for no insight comes about without momentary concentration. And
again, insight should be imderstood as the three contemplations of impermanence,
pain, and not-self; not contemplation of impermanence alone" (Vism-nilit 9-10).
"Formations are all impermanent:
When he sees thus with understanding
And turns away from what is ill,
That is the path to pm'ity" (Dhp 277). [3】
And iii some instances by jhaiia and imderstcuidmg, according as it is said:
"He is near imto Nibbana
lit whom are jhaiia and imderstcuuiiiig" (Dhp 372).
And iii some instances by deeds (kamma), etc., according as it is said:
"By deeds, vision and righteousness,
By virtue, the subliniest life~
By these are mortals purified,
And not by lineage and wealth" (M III 262).
And iii some instances by virtue, etc., according as it is said:
"He who is possessed of constant virtue,
Who has imderstaiidmg, and is concentrated,
Who is strenuous and diligent as well,
Will cross the flood so difficult to cross" (S153).
And iii some instances by the foiuieiations of mindfulness, etc., according as it
is said: "Bhikkhus, this path is the only way for the purification of beings ... for the
realization of Nibbaiia, that is to say the fom' foimdations of mindfulness" (D II
290); and similarly in the case of the light efforts, and so on. But in the answer to
this question it is taught by virtue and the other two.
7. Here is a brief coimnentary [on the stanza]. Established well in virtue: standing
on virtue. It is onlv one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to "stand on
virtue" So the meaning here is this: being established well m virtue by fiilfillmg
virtue. A man: a living being. Wise: possessing the kind of imderstaiidiiig that is
born of kamma by means of a rebii'th-linkiiig with triple loot-cause. Develops
consciousness mid tuiderstmiding: develops both concentration and insight. For it is
concentration that is described here tinder the heading of "consciousness," and
insight under that of "understanding."4 Ardent (atapin): possessing energy. For it is
energy that is called "ardour" (atapm) in the sense of burning up and consuming
(atnpana-paritapana) defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent. Sagacious: it is

4. "'Develops, applies to both /consciousness, and 'undeistanding/ But are they
mimdaite 01 siipraiiumdaiie? Tliey are supramundane, because the sublime goal is
described； for one developing them is said to disentangle the tangle of craving by cutting
it off at the path moment, and that is not mundane. But the mundane are included here
too because they immediately precede, since supramundane (see Ch. Ill n._5)
concentration and insight are impossible without numdane concentration and insight
to precede them; for without the access and absorption concentration in one whose
vehicle is serenity, or without the momentary concentration in one whose vehicle is
insight, and without the gateways to liberation (see XXI.66f.), the supianumdai'ie can
never in either case be reached" (Vism-inlit 13). "With triple root-cause" means with
non-greed, none-hate, and non-delusion.

`8
imderstaiiding that is called "sagacity"; possessing that, is the meaning. This word
shows protective understanding. For imderstaiidmg is mentioned three times in
the reply to the question. Herein, the first is naive understandmg, the second is
undeistanding consisting in insight, while the third is the protective understanding
that guides all affairs. He sees fear (bhmjam ikklmti) in the roiuui of rebirths, thus he
is a bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle: [4] Just as a man standing on the
groiuui and taking lip a well-sharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of
bamboos, so too, he^this bhikkhu who possesses the six tilings, namely this virtue,
and this concentration described imder the heading of consciousness, and this
threefold understanding, and this ardour—standing on the groirnd of virtue and
taking up with the hand of protective-imderstaiiding exerted by the power ot energy
the knife of insight-tinderstanding well-sharpened on the stone of concentration,
might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had
overgrown his own life's continuity. But it is at the moment of the path that he is
said to be disentangling that tangle; at the moment of fruition he has disentangled
the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings m the world with its deities. That
is why the Blessed One said:
"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and imdei standing,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."
8. Herein there is nothing for him to do about the [naive] luiderstaiiding on
account of which he is called wise; for that has been established in him simply by
the influence of previous kamma. But the words ardent and sagacious mean that by
persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness
with imderstandiiig he should, having become well established in virtue, develop
the serenity and insight that are described as coiicentrntion and luiderstnnding. This
is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification imder the headings of virtue,
concentration, and imderstaiuimg there.
9.	What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the dispensation that is
good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold clear-vision, etc., the
avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means to
surmotmtmg the states of loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects,
prevention of transgression etc., piuification from the three kinds of defilements,
and the reason for the states of stream-entiy and so on. How?
10.	Here the tramiiig of higher virtue is shown by virtue; the traming of higher
consciousness, by concentration) and the training of higher understanding, by
understanding.
The dispensation's goodness in the beginning is shown by virtue. Because of the
passage, "And what is the beginning of profitable things? Virtue that is quite
purified" (S V 143), and because of the passage beginning, "The not doing of any
evil" (Dhp 183), virtue is the beginning of the dispensation. And that is good because
it brings about the special qualities of non-remorse,5 and so on. Its goodness in the
5. One who is virtuous has nothing to be remorseful about.
`9
middle is shown by concentrntion. [5] Because of the passage beginning, "Entei.ing
upon the profitable" (Dhp 183), concentration is the middle of the dispensation.
And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power,
and so on. Its goodness in the end is shown by understmiding. Because of the passage,
"The piuifyiiig of one's own mind—this is the Buddhas' dispensation" (Dhp 183),
and because understanding is its culmination, luiderstnnding is the end of the
dispensation. And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to
the desired and the imdesired. For this is said:
"Just as a solid massive rock
Remains luishaken by the wind,
So too, in face of blame and praise
The wise remain immovable" (Dhp 81).
11. Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clear-vision is shown by virtue.
For with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear-
vision, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct-
knowledge is shown by concentration. For with the support of perfected
concentration one arrives at the six kinds of direct-knowledge, but nothing besides
that. The necessary condition for the categories of discrixnmation is shown by
understanding. For with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the
four kinds of disciimination, but not for any other reason.6
And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires
is shown by virtue. The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification
of self is shown by concentration. The cultivation of the middle way is shown by
luiderstnnding.
12.	Likewise the menus for surmoiuiting the states of loss is shown by virtue; the means
for siumounting the element of sense desires, by concentrntion; and the means for
surmoiuiting all becoming, by tuiderstanduig.
And the nbmidoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue;
that by suppression is shown by coiicentrntiou; and that by cutting off is shown by
understanding.
13.	Likezvise prevention ofdefileinentsf trmisgression is shown by virtue; prevention of
obsession (by defilement) is shown by concentration; prevention of inherent
tendencies is shown by iinderstatiding.
And fmrificntion from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue; purification
from the defilement of craving, by concentration; and purification from the
defilement of (false) views, by tinderstmiding.
6. The three kinds of clear-vision are: recollection of past lives, knowledge of the
passing away and reappearance of beings (divine eye), and knowledge of destruction
of cankers (M I 22-23). The six kinds of direct-knowledge are: knowledge of
supernormal power, the divine ear element, penetration of niinds, recollection of past
lives, knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings, and knowledge of
destruction of cankers (M134^35). The four disci iniiiiations are those of meaning, law,
language, and intelligence (A II160).
`10
14.	[6] Likewise the reason for the states of stream-entiy and once-retmn is shown
by virtue; that for the state of non-rettirn, by concentrntion; that for Araliantsliip by
tinderstmiduig. For the stream-enterer is called "perfected in the kinds of virtue";
and likewise the once-returner. But the non-returner is called ''perfected in con-
centration/' And the Araliant is called "perfected in tindei standing" (see A1233).
15.	So thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown,
that is, the three trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary
condition for the threefold clear-vision, the avoidance of the two extremes and the
cultivation of the middle way the means for surmoiuitmg the states of loss, etc.,
the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention of transgression, etc.,
purification from the three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of
stream-entiy, and so on.
[II. Virtue]
16.	However, even when this path of piuification is shown in this way trnder the
headings of virtue, concentration and imderstaiidmg, each comprising various
special qualities, it is still only shown extremely briefly. And so since that is
iiisufficient to help all, there is, in order to show it in detail, the following set of
questions dealing in the first place with virtue:
(i)	What is virtue?
(ii)	In what sense is it virtue?
(iii)	What are its characteristic, fimction, nianifestation, and proximate
cause?
What are the benefits of virtue?
How many kinds of virtue are there?
What is the defiling of it?
What is the cleansing of it?
17. Here are the answers:
(i) What is virtue? It is the states beginning with volition present in one who
abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the
duties. For this is said in the Patisambhida: "What is virtue? There is virtue as
volition, virtue as conscioiisness-coricoinitant,7 virtue as restraint, [7] virtue as non-
iransgression" (Patis 144).
Herein, virtue as volition is the volition present in one who abstains from killing
living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. Virtue as consciousness-
concomitant is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things, and so on.
Fiu tliermore, virtue as volition is the seven volitions [that accompany the first sevenl of
the [ten] coiuses of action (kamma) in one who abandons the killing of living tilings,
and so on. Virtue ns consciousness-concomitant is the [three remaining] states consisting
of non-covetousness, non-ill will, and right view, stated in the way beginning,
"Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness" (DI 71).
7. "Consciousness-concoinitants" (cetasika) is a collective term for feeling, perception,
and formation, variously subdivided; in other words, aspects of mentality that arise
together with consciousness.
`11
18. Virtue ns restraint should be imderstood here as restraint in five ways: restraint
by the rules of the community (pntimokkhn), restraint by mindfulness, restraint
by knowledge, restraint by patience, and restraint by energy. Herein, ^restraint
by the Patimokkha" is this: "He is furnished, fully furnished, with this
Patimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)〃 "Restraint by mindfulness" is this: "He guards
the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty" (D I 70). "Restraint by
knowledge" is this:
"The currents in the world that flow, Ajita,"
said the Blessed One,
"Are stemmed by means of mindfulness;
Restraint of currents I proclaim,
By understanding they are dammed" (Sn 1035);
and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what is called "l'estiaint by
patience" is that given in the way beginning, "He is one who bears cold and heat〃
(M110). And what is called ''restraint by energy" is that given in the way beginning,
"He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises" (M 111); piuification
of livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and the abstinence,
in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should
all be imderstood to be "virtue as restraint/"
Virtue as non-transgression is the non-traiisgression, by body or speech, of precepts
of virtue that have been imdertaken.
This, in the first place, is the answer to the question, "What is virtue?" [8] Now,
as to the rest——
19.	(ii) In what sense is it virtue? It is vii tue (slla) in the sense of composing (silniin).8
What is this composing? It is either a coordinating (samadhann), meaning non-
mconsistencv of bodily action, etc., due to viituousness; or it is an upholding
(iipadharnna),8 meaning a state of basis (adhara) owing to its serving as foimdation
for profitable states. For those who imderstand etymology admit only these two
meanings. Others, however, comment on the meaning here in the way beginning,
"The meaning of virtue (slla) is the meaning of head (sira), the meaning of virtue is
the meaning of cool (sJtnla)/,
20.	(iii) Now, what are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate
cause? Here:
The characteristic of it is composing
Even when analyzed in various ways,
As visibility is of visible data
Even when analyzed in various ways.
Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visible-data base even when analyzed
into the various categories of blue, yellow, etc., because even when analyzed into
these categories it does not exceed visible-ness, so also this same composing,
described above as the cooidmatiiig of bodily action, etc., and as the foimdation of
8. SJlana and upadharmin in this meaning (cf. Ch. I, §141 and sandharmia, XIV61) are
not in PED.
`12
profitable states, is the characteristic ol virtue even when analyzed Into the various
categories of volition, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it
does not exceed the state of coordination and foimdation.
21.	While such is its characteristic:
Its function has a double sense:
Action to stop misconduct, then
Achievement as the quality
Of blamelessness in virtuous men.
So what is called virtue should be imderstood to have the function (nature) of
stopping misconduct as its fiuiction (natme) in the sense of action, and a blameless
function (nature) as its function (nature) in the sense of acl'iievement. For under
[these headings oi] chaiacteristic, etc., it is action (kicca) 01 it is achievement (sampntti)
that is called "fimction〃 (rasa~natme).
22.	Now, virtue, so say those who know,
Itself as piuity will show;
And for its proximate cause they tell
The pair, conscience and shame, as well. [9]
"This virtue is maiiifested as the kinds of purity stated thus: "Bodilv piuity verbal
piuity, mental purity(A I 271); it is manifested, comes to be apprehended, as a
piue state. But conscience and shaine are said by those who know to be its proximate
cause; its near reason, is the meaning. For when conscience and shame are in
existence, viitue arises and persists; and when they are not, it neither arises nor
persists.
This is how virtue's characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause,
should be imderstood.
23. (iv) What are the benefits of virtue? Its benefits are the acquisition of the
several special qualities beginning with non-remorse. For this is said: "Ananda,
profitable habits (virtues) have non-remorse as their aim and non-remorse as their
benefit" (A V 1). Also it is said further: "Householder, there are these five benefits
for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one who
is vii tuoiis, possessed of virtue, obtains a large fortime as a consequence of diligence;
this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, of one
who is virtuous, possessed of vii tue, a fail name is spread abroad; this is the second
benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is
virtuous, possessed of viitue, enters an assembly whether of kliattiyas (warrior-
nobles) or brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so without fear or
hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of vii tue. Again,
one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, dies unconfused; this is the fourth benefit
for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed
of virtue, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in a happy destiny, in
the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of
virtue" (DII86). There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being
dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage
beginning, "If a bhikkhu should wish, 'May I be dear to my fellows in the life of
`13
piuity and loved by them, held in respect and honoured by them/ let him perfect
the virtues" (M133). This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special qualities
beginning with non-remorse. [10]
24. Fiu'thermore:
Dare anyone a limit place
On benefits that virtue brings,
Without which virtue clansmen find
No footing iii the dispensation?
No Ganges, and no Yamuna
No Sarabhu, SarassathI,
Or flowing Aciravatl,
Or noble River of Mali!,
Is able to wash out the stain
In tilings that breathe here in the world;
For only virtue's water can
Wash out the stain in living things.
No breezes that come bringing rain,
No balm of yellow sandalwood,
No necklaces beside, or gems
Or soft effulgence of moonbeams,
Can here avail to calm and soothe
Men's fevers in this world; whereas
This noble, this supremely cool,
Well-guarded virtue quells the flame.
Where is there to be found the scent
That can with virtue's scent compare,
And that is borne against the wind
As easily as with it? Where
Can such another stair be foiuui
That climbs, as vii tue does, to heaven?
Or yet another door that gives
Onto the City of Nibbana?
Shine as they may, there are no kings
Adorned with jewellery and pearls
That shine as does a man restraiiied
Adorned with virtue's ornament.
Virtue entirely does away
With dread of self-blame and the like;
Their vii tue to the virtuous
Gives gladness always by its fame.
From this brief sketch it may be known
How virtue brings reward, and how
This root of all good qualities
Robs of its power every fault.
`14
25. (v) Now, here is the answer to the question, How many kinds of virtue are
THERE?
1.	Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of
composing.
2.	It is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.
3.	Likewise as that of good behavioiu. and that of the beginning of the life of
purity
4.	As abstinence and non-abstinence,
5.	As dependent and independent,
6.	As temporary and lifelong,
7.	As limited and Linlimited,
8.	As mimdane and supranumdane. fill
9.	It is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.
10.	Likewise as giving precedence to self, giving precedence to the world, and
giving precedence to the Dhamma,
11.	As adhered to, not adhered to, and tranquillized.
12.	As purified, unpiiiified, and dubious.
13.	As that of the tiainei, that of the non-tramer, and that of the neither-tramer-
nor-non-tramer.
14.	It is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, of stagnation, of distinction,
of penetration.
15.	Likewise as that of bhikkhus, of bhikkhiuiis, of the not-fully-admitted, of
the lait^
16.	As natural, customary necessaiy due to previous causes,
17.	As virtue of Patimokkha restraint, of restraint of sense faculties, of
piuification of livelihood, and that concerning requisites.
18.	It is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification, etc.; for this is
said in the Patisambhida: "Five kiiuis of virtue: virtue consisting in limited
purification, vii tue consisting in lu'diiiiited purification, vii tue consisting in Itilfilled
piuification, viitue consisting in unadheied-to piuification, viitue consisting in
tranquillized piuification(Patis 142).
19.	Likewise as abandoning, refraining, volition, restraint, and non-
traiisgression.
26. 1. Herein, in the section dealing with that of one kind, the meaning should
be understood as already stated.
2. In the section dealing with that of two kinds: fiilfillmg a haining precept
announced by the Blessed One tluis: "This should be done" is keeping; not doing what
is prohibited by him thus: "This should not be done" is nvoidirig. Herein, the word-
meaiiiiig is this: they keep (carmiti) within that, they proceed as people who fulfil the
virtues, tlnis it is keeping (carittn); they preserve, they protect, they avoid, thus it is
`15
avoiding. Herein, keeping is accomplished by faith and energy； mmdiiig, by faith and
mindfiilness. This is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.
27.	3. In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behavioiu. Good
behaviour itself is that of good beJinviour; 01 what is announced for the sake of good
behaviour is that of good belinznour. This is a term for virtue other than that which
has livelihood as eighth.9 It is the initial stage of the life of piuity consisting in the
path, thus it is that of the beginning of the life ofptirity. This is a term for the virtue
that has livelihood as eighth. It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually
to be purified in the prior stage too. Hence it is said: "But his bodily action, his
verbal action, and his livelihood have already been purified earlier" (M III 289). Or
the trammg precepts called "lesser and minor" (D II 154) [12] are that of good
behaviour; the rest are that of the beginning of the life of purity. Or what is included in
the Double Code (the bhikkluis/ and bhikklulnis, Patiinokklia) is that of the begituiing
of the life of yurit]/; and that included in the duties set out in the Kliandliakas [of
Vinaya] is that of good behaviour. Through its perfection that of the beginning of the life
ofjmrity comes to be perfected. Hence it is said also "that this bhikkhu shall fulfil
the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled
the state consisting in good behaviour—that is not possible" (A III 14-15). So it is
of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of
purity.
28.	4. In the third dyad virtue as nbstinence is simply abstention from killing living
tilings, etc.; the other kinds consisting in volition, etc., are virtue as noii-nbstinence.
So it is of two kinds as abstinence and non-abstinence.
29.	5. In the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence: dependence through
craving and dependence through [false] views. Herein, that produced by one who
wishes for a fortimate kind of becoming thus, "Through this virtuous conduct
[rite] I shall become a [great] deity or some [minoi] deity" (M 1102), is dependent
through craving. That produced through such [false] view about purification as
'Turification is through virtuous conduct" (Vibh 374) is dependent through [false]
view. But the supranumdane, and the numdane that is the prerequisite for the
aforesaid supi.anumdane, are independent. So it is of two kinds as dependent and
independent
30.	6. In the fifth dyad temporary viitue is that imdertaken after deciding on a
time limit. Lifelong virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for
as long as life lasts. So it is of two kinds as temporaiy and lifelong.
31.	7. In the sixth dyad the limited is that seen to be limited by gain, fame, relatives,
limbs, or life. The opposite is unlimited. And this is said in the Patisanibl'iida: "What
is the virtue that has a limit? There is virtue that has gain as its limit, there is virtue
that has fame as its limit, there is virtue that has relatives as its limit, there is virtue
that has limbs as its limit, there is vii tue that has life as its limit. What is virtue that
9. The three kinds of profitable bodily kanmia or action (not killing or stealing or
mdidgiiig in sexual misconduct), the four kinds of profitable verbal kanuna or action
(refiaiiiiiig from lying, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip), and right livelihood
as the eighth.
`16
has gain as its limit? Here someone with gain as cause, with gain as condition,
with gain as reason, transgresses a training precept as undertaken: that virtue has
gain as its limit" (Patis I 43), [13] and the rest should be elaborated in the same
way. Also in the answer dealing with the tinlimited it is said: "What: is virtue that
does not have gain as its limit? Here someone does not, with gain as cause, with
gain as condition, with gain as reason, even arouse the thought of transgressmg a
training precept as imdertaken, how then shall he actually transgress it? That virtue
does not have gain as its limit" (Patis 144), and the rest should be elaborated in the
same way So it is of two kinds as limited and iinlimited.
32. 8. In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is mtuuinne; that not subject
to cankers is siiprmmuidnne. Herein, the muiidmie brings about improvement in futiue
becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becoming, according as it is
said: "Discipline is for the purpose of restramt, restraint is for the purpose of non-
remorse, non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening, gladdening is for the
purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity, tranquillity is
for the purpose of bliss, bliss is for the purpose of concentration, concentration is
for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision, correct knowledge and vision is
for the purpose of dispassion, dispassion is for the purpose of fading away [of
greed], fading away is for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is for the purpose
of knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance is
for the purpose of complete extinction [of craving, etc.] through not clinging. Talk
has that purpose, counsel has that purpose, support has that purpose, giving ear
has that purpose, that is to say, the liberation of the mind through not clinging"
`17
(Viii V 164). The suprnnnuidmie brings about the escape from becoming and is the
plane of reviewing knowledge. So it is of two kinds as numdane and supranumdane.
33.	9. In the first of the triads the inferior is produced by mferior zeal, [purity of]
consciousness, energy, or inquiry; the medium is produced by mediiun zeal, etc.;
the superior, by superior (zeal, and so on). That undertaken out of desire for fame is
inferior; that imdertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is medium; that
imdertaken for the sake of the noble state thus, "This has to be done" is superior. Or
again, that defiled by self-praise and disparagement of others, etc, thus, "I am
possessed of virtue, but these other bhikkhus are ill-conducted and evil-nahired〃
(M1193), is inferior; imdefiled numdane virtue is medium; supianuindaiie is superior.
Or again, that motivated by craving, the purpose of which is to enjoy continued
existence, is inferior; that practiced for the piupose of one's own deliverance is
medium; the virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is
superior. So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.
34.	10. In the second triad that practiced out of self-regard by one who regards self
and desires to abandon what is imbecoroing to self [14] is vii tue giving precedence to
self. That practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censm e
of the world is vii tue gizmig precedence to the world. That practiced out of regard for the
Dhamma and out of desire to honoiu the majesty of the Dhamma is viitue giving
precedence to the Dlinmma. So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self, and so on.
35.	11. In the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent (no. 5)
is adhered-to because it is adhered-to through craving and [false] view. That practiced
by the magnanimous ordiiiaiy man as the prerequisite of the path, and that
associated with the path in trainers, are not-adhered-to. That associated with tramers'
and non-tramers" fruition is trnnqtiillized. So it is of three kinds as adhered-to, and
so on.
36.	12. In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or
has made amends after committing one is pure. So long as he has not made amends
after committing an offence it is impure. Virtue in one who is dubious about whether
a tiling constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed
or about whether he has committed an offence is dubious. Herein, the meditator
should purify impure viitue. If dubious, he should avoid cases about which he is
doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up. In this way his mind will be kept at
rest. So it is of three kinds as pure, and so on.
37.	13. In the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the
[first] three fruitions is that of the trainer. That associated with the fruition of
Arahantship is that of the noii-traiiieK The l'emaining kinds are that of the neither-
trainer-nor-non-trainer. So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer, and so on.
38.	But in. tlie world tlie natiue of such and such beings is called theii "habit" {slla) of
which they say: "This one is of happy habit (stiklui-slla), this one is of Luiltappy habit,
this one is of quairelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit." Because of that it is
said iii the Patisainbliida figiuatively: "Three kiiuis of virtue (habit): profitable virtue,
improfitable viitue, indeterminate virtue" (Patis 144). So it is also called of three kiiuis
as profitable, and so on. Of these, the iQiprofitable is not included here since it has
nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the chaiacteristic, which
define viitue in the sense intended in this [chapter]. So the threefoldness should be
understood onlv in the way already stated.
39. 14. In the first of the tetrads:
The luwirtuous he cultivates,
He visits not the virtuous,
And iii his ignorance he sees
No fault iii a transgression here, [15]
With wrong thoughts often in his mind
His faculties he will not guard—
Virtue in such a constitution
Comes to partake ofdimitmtion.
But he whose mind is satisfied.
With virtue that has been achieved,
Who never thinks to stir himself
And take a meditation subject up,
Contented with mere vii tiiousness,
Nor striving for a higher state—
His vii tue bears the appellation
Of that partaking of stagnation.
But who, possessed of virtue, strives
With concentration for his aim~
`19
That bhikklui's virtue in its fiuiction
Is called partaking of distinction.
Who finds mere virtue not enough
But has dispassion for his goal—
His virtue through such aspiration
Comes to partake of penetration.
So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.
40.	15. In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to
keep irrespective of what is aimoimced for bhikkhimis. This is the virtue of bhikkhus.
There are tmining precepts amioimced for bhikkluiriis to keep iirespective of what is
announced for bhikkluis. This is the virtue of bhikkJiums. The ten precepts of vii tue for
male and female novices are the vii tue of the not fully admitted. The five training
precepts~ten when possibleas a permanent imdertakiiig and eight as the factors of
the Uposatha Day,10 for male and female lay followers are the vii tue of the laity. So it is
of four kiiuis as the vii tue of bliikklnis, and so on.
41.	26. In the third tetrad the non-transgression on the part of Uttarakuru human
beings is natural virtue. Each clan's or locality's or sect's own rules of conduct are
customary virtue. The virtue of the Bodhisatta's mother described thus: "It is the
necessary rule, Ananda, that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mother's
womb, no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to
her" (DII13), is necessary virtue. But the virtue of such piue beings as Maha Kassapa,
etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue due to previous causes. So it
is of foiu' kinds as natural virtue, and so on.
42. 17. In the fourth tetrad:
(a)	The virtue described by the Blessed One thus: "Here a bhikkhu dwells
restramed with the Patimokklia restraint, possessed of the [proper] conduct and
resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains himself by undertaking the
precepts of training, (Vibh 244)〃 is virtue of Patimokkha restraint.
(b)	That described thus: “On seeing a visible object with the eye, [16] he
apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the eye
faculty unguarded, evil and improfitable states of covetousness and grief might
invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty,
imdertakes the restiaiiit of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On
smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On
10. Uposatha (der. from upavasati, to observe or to prepare) is the name for the day of
"fasting" or "vigil" observed on the days of the new moon, waxing half moon, full
moon, and waning half moon. On these days it is customary for laymen to iindei take
the Eight Precepts (sila) or Five Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the
Patimokklia (see note 11) is recited by bliikkhns. The two quai ter-moon days are called
the "eighth of the half moon." The Full-moon day is called the "fifteenth" (i.e. fifteen
days from the new moon) and is the last day of the lunar month. That of the new moon
is called the "fourteenth" when it is the second and fourth new moon of the foiu-
month season (i.e. foiuteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the
"fifteenth." This compensates for the irregiilarities of the liuiar period.
`20
touching a tangible object with the body ... On cognizing a mental object with the
mind, he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left
the mind faculty imguarded, evil and improfitable states of covetousness and grief
might invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the mind
faculty undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty (M1180), is virtue of restraint of
the sense faculties.
(c)	Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails tiaiisgression of the six training
precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning
with "Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, piu siiiiig gain with gain" (MII75) is virtue
of livelihood purificntion.
(d)	Use of the four requisites that is piuified by the reflection stated in the way
beginning, "Reflecting wisely he uses the robe only for protection from cold" (MI
10) is called virtue concerning requisites.
43. Here is an explanatory exposition together with a word commentary starting
from the beginning.
(a) Here: in this dispensation. A bhikkhu: a clansman who has gone forth out of
faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the roimd of rebirths (smnsare bhmjmij
ikkJmiinta) or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and pieced together,
and so on.
Restrained with the Patimokkha restraint: here ^Patimokkha/r (Rule of the
Conuiumity)11 is the virtue of the training precepts; for it frees (mokkheti) him who
protects (ynti) it, guards it, it sets him free (mocnyati) from the pains of the states of
loss, etc., that is why it is called Pntimokkhn. "Restraint:" is restiamiiig; this is a term
for bodily and verbal non-transgression. The Patimokkha itself as restraint is
"Patimokkha restraint./r "Restrained with the Patimokkha iestiaint〃 is restramed
by means of the restraint consisting in that Patimokkha; he has it, possesses it, is
the meaning. Dwells: bears himself m one of the postures. [17]
44. The meaning of possessed of [the proper] conduct mid resort, etc., should be
luuierstood in the way in which it is given in the text. For this is said: "Possessed of
[the proper] conduct and resort: there is [proper] conduct and improper conduct.
Herein, what is improper conduct? Bodily transgression, verbal ticuisgression,
bodily and verbal transgression—this is called improper conduct. Also all
luwii'tuousness is improper conduct. Here someone makes a livelihood by gifts of
bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and
tooth sticks, or by flattery 01 by bean-soupeiy or by fondling, or by going on errands
on foot, or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the
Buddhas—this is called improper conduct. Herein, what is [proper] conduct? Bodily
11. The Suttavibhaiiga, the first book of the Vinaya Pitaka, contains in its two parts
the 227 rules for bhikkhus and the rides for bltikklnuUs, who have received the admission
(upmsmnpadn), together with accoimts of the incidents that led to the aimotmcement of
the rules, the modification of the rules and the explanations of them. The bare rules
themselves form the Patimokkha for bhikkhus and that for bhikkhunis. They are also
known as the "two codes" (dve matika). The Patimokklia is recited by bhikkhus on the
Uposatha days of the full moon and new moon.
`21
non-traiisgression, verbal non-transgression, bodily and verbal non-traiisgression~
this is called [proper] conduct. Also all restramt through vii tue is [proper] conduct.
Here someone "does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of
leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery,
or by bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on enands on foot, or by one 01
other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas—this is called
[proper] conduct."
45. [Proper] resort: there is [proper] resort and improper resort. Herein, what is
improper resort? Here someone has prostitutes as resort, or he has widows, old
maids, eiunichs, bhikkhtinis, or taverns as resort; or he dwells associated with kings,
kings' ministers, sectarians, sectal,ians, disciples, in imbeconiiiig association with
laymen; or he cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are faithless,
imtrustmg, abusive and rude, who wish harm, wish ill, wish woe, wish no stu cease
of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhtinls, for male and female devotees [181—tliis
is called improper resort. Herein, what is [proper] resort? Here someone does not
have prostitutes as resort ...or taverns as resort; he does not dwell associated with
kings. • • sectarians' disciples, in unbecoming association with laymen; he cultivates,
frequents, honours, such families as are faithful and trusting, who are a solace,
where the yellow cloth glows, where the breeze of sages blows, who wish good,
wish well, wish joy wish surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkluinis, for
male and female devotees—this is called [proper] resort. Thus he is furnished with,
fully fiuiiished with, provided with, fully provided with, supplied with, possessed
of, endowed with, this [proper] conduct and this [proper] resort. Hence it is said,
'Possessed of [the proper] conduct and resort"' (Vibh 24647).
46.	Furthermore, [proper] conduct and resort should also be understood here in
the iollowmg way; for improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal. Herein,
what is bodily improper conduct? "Here someone acts disrespectfully before the
Comnumity, and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus, sits jostling them, stands in
front of them, sits in front of them, sits on a high seat, sits with his head covered,
talks standing up, talks waving his aims ... walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus
walk without sandals, walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk, walks
on a walk while they walk on the ground ... stands pushing elder bhikkhus, sits
pushing them, prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat... and in the bath house
...without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on [the stove] ... bolts the door ...
and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus, enters it in
front of them, bathes jostling them, bathes in front of them, comes out jostling
them, comes out in front of them ... and entering inside a house he goes jostling
elder bhikkhus, goes in front of them, pushing foi'ward he goes in front of them ...
and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the
family ... the girls of the family sit, there he enters abruptly and he strokes a
chilcTs head" (Nidd I 228-29). This is called bodily improper conduct.
47.	Herein, what is verbal improper conduct? "Here someone acts disrespectfully
before the Conmuuiity. Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhamma,
answers questions, recites the Patiinokklia, talks standing up, [19] talks waving his
aims ... having entered inside a house, he speaks to a woman or a girl thus: 'You, so-
`22
and-so of such-and-such a dan, what is there? Is there rice gruel? Is there cooked lice?
Is there any hard food to eat? What shall we drink? What hard food shall we eat? What
soft food shall we eat? Or what will you give me?'~he chatters like this" (Nidd 1230).
This is called verbal improper conduct.
48.	Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to that.
Furthermore, a bhikkhu is respectful, deferential, possessed of conscience and
shame, wears his inner robe properly, wears his upper robe properly, his maimer
inspires confidence whether in moving forwai.ds or backwards, looking ahead or
aside, bending or stretching, his eyes are downcast, he has (a good) deportment,
he guards the doors of his sense facilities, knows the right measure in eating, is
devoted to wakefulness, possesses mindfulness and full awareness, wants little, is
contented, is strenuous, is a careful observer of good behaviour, and treats the
teachers with great respect. This is called (proper) conduct.
This firstly is how (proper) conduct should be imderstood.
49.	(Proper) resort is of three kinds: (proper) resort as support, (proper) resort as
guarding, and (proper) resort as anchoring. Herein, what is (proper) resort as
support? A good friend who exhibits the instances of talk,12 in whose presence one
hears what has not been heard, corrects what has been heard, gets rid of doubt,
rectifies one's view, and gains confidence; or by training tmder whom one grows
in faith, vii tue, learning, generosity and imderstaiuimg—this is called (proper) resort
as support.
50.	What is (proper) resort as guarding? Here "A bhikkhu, having entered inside
a house, having gone into a street, goes with downcast eyes, seeing the length of a
plough yoke, restrained, not looking at an elephant, not looking at a hoi.se, a carriage,
a pedestrian, a woman, a man, not looking up, not looking down, not staring this
way and that" (Nidd 1474). This is called (proper) resort as guarding.
51.	What is (proper) resort as aiichormg? It is the four foundations of mindfulness
on which the mind is anchored; for this is said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus,
what is a bliikkhu's resort, his own native place? It is these four foimdations of
mindfulness" (S V 148). This is called (proper) resort as anchoring.
Being thus furnished with ... endowed with, this (proper) conduct and this
(proper) resort, he is also on that account called "one possessed of (proper) conduct
and resort/' [201
52.	Seeing fear in the slightest fault (§42): one who has the habit (slla) of seeing tear
in faults of the minutest measiue, of such kinds as unintentional contraveiung ot a
minor training rule of the Patimokklia, or the arising of improfitable thoughts. He
trains himself by undertaking (samadaya) the precepts of trnining: whatever there is
among the precepts of training to be trained in, in all that he trains by taking it up
12. The "ten instances of talk" (dasa kathavattlnlni) refer to the kinds of talk given in
the Suttas thus: "Such talk as is concerned with effacement, as favoius the heart's release,
as leads to complete dispassion, fading, cessation, peace, direct knowledge,
enlightenment, Nibbana, that is to say: talk on wanting little, contentment, seclusion,
aloofness from contact, strenuousness, viitue, concentration, understanding,
deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliveiance" (M1145; III 113).
`22
rightly (smnrna adnyn). And here, as far as the words, "one restrained by the
Patimokkha restraint// virtue of Patimokklia restraint is shown by discourse in
terms of persons.13 But all that beginning with the words, "possessed of [proper]
conduct and i’esort〃 should be understood as said in order to show the way of
practice that perfects that vii tue in him who so practices it.
53.	(b) Now, as regards the vii tue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the
way beginning, "on seeing a visible object with the eye/7 herein he is a bhikkhu
established in the virtue of Patimokklia restiaiiit. On seeing a visible object with the eye:
on seeing a visible object with the eye-coi'isciousness that is capable of seeing visible
objects and has borrowed the name "eye" from its iiistnunent. But the Ancients {porana)
said: "The eye does not see a visible object because it has no niiiui. The niiiui does not
see because it has no eyes. But when there is the iinpmgement of door and object he
sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its physical basis. No\^
(an idiom) such as this is called an 'accessory locution/ (sasamblmrakatlia), like 'He shot
him with his bow^ and so on. So the meaning here is this: 'On seeing a visible object
with eye-conscioiisness/〃14
54.	Apprehends neither the signs: he does not apprehend the sign of woman or
man, or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beaut》etc.; he
stops at what is merely seen. Nor the particulars: he does not apprehend any aspect
classed as hand, foot, smile, laughter, talk, looking ahead, looking aside, etc., which
has acquired the name "particular" (nmibyanjana) because of its paiticulaiiziiig
(mm miu b}jm~ijminto) defilements, because of its making them manifest themselves.
13.	See Ch. IV n. 27.
14.	u,On seeing a visible object with the e\jen\ if the eye were to see the visible object, then
(organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too; but that is not so.
Why? Because the eye has no thought (acetanatta). And then, were consciousness itself
to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent
of sense resistance (appatighabhavato); but that is not so either because there is no seeing
iii all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that
sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by
walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the
case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is
enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees.
"'When there is the impingement of door and object': what is intended is: when a visible
datum as object has come into the eye's focus. 'One sees': one looks (oloketi); for when
the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (obhasente)
by means of the special quality of its support a visible datiun as object that is assisted
by light (aloka), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datiun.
Aiuihere the ilkuninating is the revealing of the visible datiun according to its individual
essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (paccakkhato).
"Here it is the 'sign of woman' because it is the cause of perceiving as 'woman' all
such things as the shape that is grasped imder the heading of the visible data
(materiality) invariably foiuid in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (avisadata)
of the flesh of the breasts, the beaidlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair,
the im-clear-ciit stance, walk, and so on. The 'sign of man, is in the opposite sense.
`23
He only apprehends what is really there. Like the Elder Maha Tissa who dwelt at
Cetiyapabbata.
55. It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Aiuu adhapiua
for alms, a certain danghteriiilaw of a clan, who had quarrelled with her husbaiui
and had set out early from Aiuuadhapiua all dressed up and tricked out like a
celestial nymph to go to her relatives' home, saw him on the road, and being low-
minded, [21] she laughed a loud laugh. [Wondeiing] "What is that?" the elder
looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness (ugliness),
he reached Araliantsliip.15 Hence it was said:
"He saw the bones that were her teeth,
And kept in mind his first perception;
And standing on that very spot
The elder became an Amhant."
But her husband, who was going after her, saw the elder and asked, "Venerable
sir, did you by any chance see a woman?" The elder told him:
"Whether it was a man 01 woman
That went by I noticed not,
'"The sign of beaiity' here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of
lust. By the word 'etc/ the sign of resentment (patigha), etc., are included, which should
be imderstood as the imdesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And
here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of
equaiiiiiiity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraiiit in the delusion that
arises due to overlooking, or since 'forgetfulness of Llnknowing, is said below (§57).
And here the 'sign of eqnai'iiimty/ should be imderstood as an object that is the basis
for the kind of equanimity associated with luikiiowing through overlooking it. So 'the
sign of beauty, etc/ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion.
“*He stops at zuhat is merely seen': according to the Sutta method, The seen shall be
merely seen' (Ud 8). As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the
consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not
fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that.…In one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the
limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with respect to them successively become
particularized, which is why they are called 'particulars/ But these are simply modes
of mterpretiiig (sannivesakara) the kinds oi: inateiiality derived from the (four) priinaiies
that are interpreted (sannivittha) in such and such wise; for apart from that there is in
the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on〃 (Vism-nilit 40-41). See also Ch.
HI, note 31.
15. "As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his meditation subject
iii niind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage, he looked up with the noise of
the laughter, (wondering) 'What is that?7 'Perception of foidness/ is perception of bones;
for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seenis as soon
as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the coimterpart sign with access
jhaiia because he had developed the pieliiiiiiiaiy-work well. While he stood there he
reached the first jhaiia. Then he made that the basis for insight, which he augmented
imtil he attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankers"
(Vism-nilit 41 一42).
`24
But only that on this high road
There goes a group of bones/'
56.	As to the words tJiroitgli which, etc., the meaning is: by reason of which, because
of which non-restraiiit of the eye faculty if he, if that person, left the eye faculty
unguarded, remained with the eye door unclosed by the door-panel of mindfulness,
these states of covetousness, etc., might invnde, might pursue, might threaten, him. He
enters upon the way of its restraint: he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty
by the door-paiiel of mindfulness. It is the same one of whom it is said he guards the
eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye fnaihy.
57.	Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-reshaiiit in the actual eye faculty
since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eye-sensitivity.
On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eye's focus, then,
after the life-contiiuiiun has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element
accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-
consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with
the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless niiiid-consciousness-
element with the fiuiction of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless
niiiid-coi'isciousness-element accomplishing the fimction of deteimining arises and
ceases. Next to that, impulsion impels.16 Herein, there is neither restramt nor non-
restramt on the occasion of the life-contiiuuun, or on any of the occasions beginning
with adverting. But there is non-restramt if luwirtuousness 01 forgetfuhiess or
imkiiowmg or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When
this happens, it is called "'non-restraint in the eye faculty/' [22]_
58. Why is that? Because when tliis happens, the door is not guarded, nor are the
life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series. Like what? Just as, when
a city's foiu. gates are not seciued, although inside the city house doors, storehouses,
rooms, etc., are seciued, yet all property inside the city is imguai ded and luiprotected
since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please, so too, when
luwii tuoiisness, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no i.estmint, then the door too
is unguarded, and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the
cognitive series beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then
the door too is guarded and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of
16. To expect to find in the Parmnntthatnanjilsn an exposition of the "cognitive series"
(citta-vithi), and some explanation of the individual members in addition to what is to
be foimd in the Visuddhimagga itself, is to be disappointed. There are only fragmentaiy
treatments. All that is said here is this:
"There is no luwirtuousness, in other words, bodily 01 verbal misconduct, in the
five doors; consequently restraint of tinvirtuousness happens through the inind door,
and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of
forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are improfitable
states opposed to niindhilness, etc.; and there is no arising of tinvii tuousness consisting
iii bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door impulsions do not give rise
to intimation. And the five kinds of non-iestiaiiit beginning with luwirtuousness are
stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as
vii tue" (Vism-mht 42). See also Ch. iy note 13.
`25
the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like what? Just as, when the city gates
are seciued, although inside the city the houses, etc., are not secured, yet all properly
inside the city is well guarded, well protected, since when the city gates are shut there
is no ingress for robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in impulsion, the door
too is guarded and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the
cognitive series beginning with adverting. Tluis although it actually arises at the moment
of impulsion, it is nevertheless called "lestmint in the eye facility"
59.	So also as regards the phrases oil hearing a soiuid with the ear and so on. So it is
this virtue, which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension ot signs
entailing defilement with respect to visible objects, etc., that should be imderstood
as virtue of restraint of faculties.
60.	(c) Now, as regards the virtue of livelihood piuification mentioned above next
to the viitue of restramt of the faculties (§42), the words of the six precepts announced
on account of livelihood mean, of the following six trammg precepts amtoimced thus:
"With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to
wishes, lays claim to a higher than human state that is non-existent, not a fact," the
contravention of which is defeat (expulsion from the Order); "with livelihood as
cause, with livelihood as reason, he acts as go-between, the contravention of which
is an offence entailing a meeting of the Order; "with livelihood as cause, with
livelihood as reason, he says, yA bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an
Aiahant,'" the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of it;
"with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhu who is not sick eats
superior food that he has ordered for his own use," the contravention of which is
an offence reqiiiiiiig expiation: "With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason,
a bhikkhitnl who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own
use," the contravention of which is an offence reqiiiriiig confession; "with livelihood
as cause, with livelihood as reason, one who is not sick eats curry 01 boiled rice
[23] that he has ordered for his own use/' the contravention of which is an offence
of wi.ongdoing (Vin V 146). Of these six precepts.17
61.	As regards schemiug, etc. (§42), this is the text: "Herein, what is scheming? It
is the grimacing, grimaceiy scheming, schemery, schemedness,18 by what is called
rejection of requisites or by indirect talk, or it is the disposing, posing, composing,
of the deportment on the part of one bent on gain, honoiu' and renown, of one of
evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called scheming.
62.	"Herein, what is talking? Talking at others, talking, talking roimd, talking tip,
continual talking up, persuading, continual persuading, suggesting, continual
suggesting, ingratiating chatter, llatteiy bean-soapery, fondling, on the part of one
bent on gain, honoiu. and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is
called talking.
17.	This apparently incomplete sentence is also in the Pali text. It is not clear why
(BPS Ed.)
18.	The formula "kuhana kiihax/ana kuhitnttmii," i.e. verbal noun in two forms and
abstract noirn from pp., all from the same root, is conunon in Abliidliaimna definitions.
It is sometimes hard to produce a corresponding effect in English, yet to render such
groups with words of different derivation obscures the meaning and confuses the effect.
`26
63.	"Herein, what is hinting? A sign to others, giving a sign, indication, giving
indication, indirect talk, roiuidabout talk, on the part of one bent on gain, honour
and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called hinting.
64.	"Herein, what is belittling? Abusing of others, disparaging, reproachmg,
snubbing, continual snubbing, ridicule, continual ridicule, deiiigration, continual
demgration, tale-bearmg, backbiting, on the part of one bent on gain, honour and
renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called belittling.
65.	^Herein, what is piu siiiiig gain with gain? Seeking, seeking foi> seeking out, going
iii search of, searching for, searching out material goods by means of material goods,
such as carrying there goods that have been got from here, or carrying here goods that
have been got from there, by one bent on gain, honotu' and renown, by one of evil
wishes, a prey to wishes一this is called piusiiiiig gain with gain."19 (Vibh 352-53)
66.	The meaning of this text should be imderstood as follows: Firstly as regards
description of scheming: on the part of one bent on gain, honour mid renown is on the
part of one who is bent on gain, on honoiu*, and on reputation; on the part of one
who longs for them, is the meaning. [24] Of one of evil wishes: of one who wants to
show qualities that he has not got. A prey to wishes:20 the meaning is, of one who is
attacked by them. And after this the passage beginning or by zvJmt is called rejection
of requisites is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the
Maliaiiiddesa as rejection of requisites, indirect talk, and that based on deportment.
67.	Herein, [a bhikkhu] is invited to accept robes, etc., and, precisely because he
wants them, he refuses them out of evil wishes. And then, since he knows that
those householders believe in him implicitly when they think, "Oil, how lew are
our lord's wishes! He will not accept a thing!" and they put fine robes, etc., before
him by various means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be
compassionate towards them—it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes the cause
of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads, that should be imderstood
as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites.
68. For this is said in the Mahaiiiddesa: "What is the instance of scheming called
rejection of requisites? Here householders invite bhikkhus [to accept] robes, alms
food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is ot
evil wishes, a prey to wishes, wanting robes ... alms food ... resting place ... the
requisite of medicine as cine for the sick, refuses robes ... alms food ... resting
place ... the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, because he wants more. He
says: 'What has an ascetic to do with expensive robes? It is proper for an ascetic to
gather rags from a charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and
make them into a patchwork cloak to wear. What has an ascetic to do with expensive
19. The rendeimgs "scheming" and so on in this context do not in all cases agree
with PED. They have been chosen after careful consideration. The rendering "rejection
of requisites^ takes the preferable reading patisedhmui though the more conmion reading
here is patisevana (cultivation).
20 The Pali is: “kci卿dkatnssn ti icchai/a apjakntassa; upaddutassa ti attho." Icchaya apakatassa
simply resolves the compound icchapjakatassa and is therefore untranslatable into
English. Such resolutions are therefore sometimes omitted in this translation.
`27
alms food? It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of liunps [of
food into his bowl] while he wanders for gleanings. What has an ascetic to do with
an expensive resting place? It is proper for an ascetic to be a tree-root-dweller or an
open-aii-dweller. What has an ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine
as ciue for the sick? It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid ui.ine21
and broken galliuits/ Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse aims food,
[25] uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the
sick. Then householders think, 'This ascetic has few wishes, is content, is secluded,
keeps aloof from company, is strenuous, is a preacher of asceticism/ and they invite
him more and more [to accept) robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite
of medicine as ciue for the sick. He says: 'With three things present a faithful
clansman produces much merit: with faith present a faithful clansman produces
much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much
merit, with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much
merit. You have faith; the goods to be given are here; and I am here to accept. If I
do not accept, then you will be deprived of the merit. That is no good to me. Rather
will I accept out of compassion for you/7 Accordingly he accepts many robes, he
accepts much alms food, he accepts many resting places, he accepts many requisites
of medicine as cure for the sick. Such grimacing, griinaceiy, scheming, schemery,
schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites'
(Nidd 1224-25).
69. It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, who gives it to be imderstood
verbally in some way or other that he has attained a higher than human state, that
should be understood as the instance of scheming called indirect talk, according
as it is said: "What is the instance of scheming called iiidirect talk? Here someone
of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired, ftliii'ikmg] Thus people will
admire me, speaks words about the noble state. He says, 'He who wears such a
robe is a very important ascetic/ He says, yHe who carries such a bowl, metal cup,
water filler, water strainer, keyf wears such a waist band, sandals, is a very important
ascetic/ He says, 'He who has such a preceptor ... teacher ... who has the same
preceptor, who has the same teacher, who has such a friend, associate, intimate,
companion; he who lives in such a monastery, lean-to, mansion, villa,22 cave, grotto,
hut, pavilion, watch tower, hall, bam, meeting hall, [26] room, at such a tree root, is
a very iinpoi tant ascetic/ Or alternatively, all-gushing, all-griinacing, all-scheniiiig,
all-talkative, with an expression of adimration, he utters such deep, mysterious,
cunning, obscure, supranumdane talk suggestive of voidness as Tliis ascetic is an
obtaiiier of peaceful abidings and attainments such as these/ Such grimacing,
griinaceiy scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming
called indirect talk" (Nidd 1226-27).
70. It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, which takes the form of deportment
influenced by eagerness to be admired, that: should be imderstood as the instance of
21	"'Putrid urine, is the name for all kinds of cow's urine whether old or not" (Vism-
nilit 45). Fermented cow's uiine with gallnuts (inyiobalan) is a conmion Indian medicine
today.
22	It is not always certain now what kind of buildings these names refer to.
`28
scheming dependent on deportment, according as it is said: "What is the instance of
scheming called deportment? Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to
be admired, [thinking] 'Thus people will admire me, composes his way of walking,
composes his way of lying down; he walks studiedly stands studiedly sits studiedly
lies down studiedly； he walks as though concentrated, stands, sits, lies down as though
concentrated; and he is one who meditates in public. Such disposing, posing,
composing, of deportment, grimacing, griinaceiy scheming, schemer^ schemedness,
is known as the instance of scheming called deportment" (Nidd 1225-26).
71.	Herein, the words by what is called rejection of requisites (§61) mean: by what is
called thus "rejection of requisites"; or they mean: by means of the rejection ot
requisites that is so called. By indirect talk means: by talking near to the subject. Of
deportment means: of the four modes of deportment (postures). Disposing is initial
posing, or careful posing. Posing is the manner of posing. Composing is preaiiaiigmg;
assiuning a tmst-mspirmg attitude, is what is meant. Grimacing is making grimaces
by showing great intenseness; facial contraction is what is meant. One who has the
habit of making grimaces is a griinacer. The griinacer's state is grimacery. Schetniiig
is hypocrisy. The way (aymia) of a schemer (kuJin) is schemery (kuhnynnn). The state
of what is schemed is schemedness.
72.	In the description of talking: talking at is talking thus on seeing people coming
to the monastery "What have you come for, good people? What, to invite bhikkhus?
If it is that, then go along and I shall come later with fmy bowl]/' etc.; or alternatively,
talking at is talking by advertising oneself thus, "I am Tissa, the king trusts me,
such and such king's ministers trust me/r [271 Talking is the same kind of talking
by extolling people thus, "He is a great land-owner, a great ship-ownei, a great
lord of giving." Contiiiunl talking up is talking by extolling [people] in all ways.
73.	Persiiadiug is progressively involving23 [people] thus, "Lay followers, formerly you
used to give tirst-fi’iiit alms at such a time; why do you not do so now?" imtil they say
"We shall give, venerable sir, we have had no opportunity" etc.; entangling, is what is
meant. Or alternatively seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand, he asks, "Where
are you coming from, lay follower?"—"From the sugarcane field, venerable sir"—"Is
the sugarcane sweet there?"—"One can find out by eating, venerable sir"—"It is not
allowed, lay follower, for bhikkhus to say 7Give [me some] sugarcane/" Such entangling
talk from such an entaiigler is persuading. Peisuadiiig again and again in all ways is
continual persuading.
74.	Suggesting is insiiiuatmg by specifying thus, "That family alone understands
me; if there is anything to be given there, they give it to me only"; pointing to, is
what is meant. And here the story of the oil-seller should be told.24 Suggesting in
all ways again and again is continual suggesting.
23	Naluma—tying, from nayhati (to tie). The noiui in not in PED.
24	The story of the oil-seller is given in the SammohavinodanJ (Vibh-a 483), which
reproduces this part of Vism with some additions: "Two bhikkhus, it seems, went into
a village and sat down in the sitting hall. Seeing a girl, they called her. Then one asked
`29
75.	Ijigrntintiiig chatter is endearing chatter repeated again and again without
regard to whether it is in conformity with truth and Dhanuna. Flattery is speaking
humbly always maintaining an attitude of inferiority. Bean-sotiyery is resemblance
to bean soup; for just as when beans are being cooked only a few do not get cooked,
the rest get cooked, so too the person in whose speech only a little is true, the rest
being false, is called a "bean soup"; his state is bemi-soiipery.
76.	Fondling is the state of the act of fondling. [28] For when a man fondles cliildren
on his lap or on his shoulder like a nurse~he nurses, is the meaning—that fondler's
act is the act of fondling. The state of the act of fondling is fondling.
77.	In the description of hintuig (nemittikaia): a sign (nimiiia) is any bodily or
verbal act that gets others to give requisites. Giving a sign is making a sign such as
"What have you got to eat?", etc., on seeing [people] going along with food.
Indication is talk that alludes to requisites. Giving indication: on seeing cowboys, he
asks, "Are these milk cows' calves or buttermilk cows' calves?" and when it is said,
'They are milk cows' calves, venerable sir," [he remaiks] "They are not milk cows'
calves. If they were milk cows' calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk," etc.;
and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys' parents in this wa^ and so making
them give milk, is giving indication.
78.	Indirect talk is talk that keeps near [to the subject]. And here there should be told
the story of the bhikkhu supported by a family A bhikkhu, it seenis, who was supported
by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down. The mistress of the house
was luiwillii'ig to give. On seeing him she said, "There is no rice/' and she went to a
neighbour's house as though to get rice. The bhikkhu went into the storeroom. Looking
roimd, he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door, sugar in a bowl, a siring of salt
fish iii a basket, rice in a jar, and ghee in a pot. He came out and sat down. When the
housewife came back, she said, "I did not get any rice." The bhikkhu said, "Lay follower,
I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get today—"What, venerable sir?"——
"I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door; looking for
something to hit it with, I saw a stone like a liunp of sugar in a bowl. When the snake
had been hit with the clod, it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket, and
its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar. Then the saliva mixed
with poison that came out to its moutli in its fiuy was like ghee put in a pot.〃 She thought,
'"There is no hoodwinking the shaveling/' so she gave him the sugarcane [29] and she
cooked the lice and gave it all to him with the ghee, the sugar and the fish.
79.	Such talk that keeps near fto the subject] should be understood as indirect talk.
Roiuidabout talk is talking round and roimd [the subject] as much as is allowed.
80.	In the description of belittling: abusing is abusing by means of the ten instances
of abuse.25 Disparaging is contemptuous talk. Reproaching is eniuneration of faults
such as "He is faithless, he is an tinbeliever. Snubbing is taking tip verbally thus,
the other,, Whose girl is this, venerable sir?'—'She is the daughter of om supporter the oil-
seller, Mend. When we go to her mother's house and she gives us ghee, she gives it in the
pot. And this girl too gives it in the pot as her mother does/" Quoted at Vism-nilit 46.
25. The "ten instances of abuse" (akkosa-vatthu) are given in the Saminohavinodam (Vibh-
a 340) as: "You are a thief, you are a fool, you are an idiot, you are a camel (ottha),
`30
"Don't say that here/' Snubbing in all ways, giving grotuuis and reasons, is coutiminl
snubbing. Or alternatively, when someone does not give, taking him up thus, "Oh,
the prince of givers!" is stubbing; and the thorough snubbing thus, "A niightyprmce
of givei’s!〃 is continual snubbing. Ridicule is making fun of someone thus, "What:
sort of a life has this mail who eats up his seed [grain]?" Contimial ridicule is making
fim of him more thoroughly thus, "What, you say this man is not a giver who
always gives the words There is nothing, to everyone?^
81.	Denigration26 is denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver, or by censuring
him. All-roimd denigrntion is contimial denigrntion. Tale-bearing is bearing tales from
house to house, from village to village, from district to district, [thinking] "So they
will give to me out of fear of my bearing tales." Backbiting is speaking censoriously
behind anotlier's back after speaking kindly to his face; for this is like biting the
flesh of another's back, when he is not looking, on the part of one who is unable to
look him in the face; therefore it is called backbiting. This is called belittlitig
(nippesikatn) because it scrapes off (nippeseti), wipes off, the virtuous qualities of
others as a bamboo scraper (veltipesika) does imgaent, or because it is a pursuit of
gain by grinding (nippiinsitvn) and pulveiizing others' virtuous qualities, like the
pursuit of perfiune by grinding perfumed substances; that is why it is called
belittling.
82.	In the description of pursuing gain with gain: pursuing is hunting after. Got
from here is got from this house. There is into that house. Seeking is wanting. Seeking
for is himtiiig after. Seeking out is hiuitiiig after again and again. [30] The story of
the bhikkhu who went roiuid giving away the alms he had got at first to children
the bhikkhu who went roiuid giving away the alms he had got at first to children
of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told here.
Searching, etc., are synonyms for "seeking," etc., and so the coiistruction here should
be imderstood thus: going in search ofis seeking; searching for is seeking for; searching
out is seeking out.
This is the meaning of scheming, and so on.
83. Now, [as regards the words] The evil states beginning with (§42): here the words
beginning with should be imderstood to include the many evil states given in the
Bmlnnajala Sutta in the way beginning, "Or just as some worthy ascetics, while
eating the food given by the faithful, make a living by wrong livelihood, by such
low arts as these, that is to say, by palmistiy by fortime-tellmg, by divining omens,
by interpreting dreams, marks on the body holes gnawed by mice; by fiie sacrifice,
by spoon oblation •••" (D19).
you are an ox, you are a donkey you belong to the states of loss, you belong to hell, you
are a beast, there is not even a happy or an unhappy destiny to be expected for you〃
(see also Sn-a 364).
26. The following words of this paragraph are not in PED: Papmna (denigration),
pmpjanam (nt. denigrating), nippeseti (scrapes off—from pimsati? cf. nippesikatn—
"belittling" §§42,64), nippunchati (wipes off~only pwlcliati in PED), pesikn (scraper~not
iii this sense in PED: from same root as nippeseti), nippimsitva (giinding, pounding),
abbhanga (imguent = abbhaiijana, Vism-nilit 47).
`31
84.	So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six tramiiig precepts
announced on accoimt of livelihood, and it entails the evil states beginning with
"Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain." And so it is the
abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is virtue of livelihood purification,
the word-meaiiiiig of which is this: on account of it they live, thus it is livelihood.
What is that? It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites. "Purification" is
piuifiedness. "livelihood purification" is purification of livelihood.
85.	(d) As regards the next kind called virtue concerning requisites, [here is the

and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat.
Reflecting wisely, he uses the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick only for
protection from arisen hurtful feelings and for complete iinnuinity from affliction"
(M I 10). Herein, reflecting zuisely is reflecting as the means and as the way;27 by
knowing, by reviewing, is the meaning. And here it is the reviewing stated in the
way beginning, "Foi protection from cold" that should be Liiiderstood as ^reflecting
wisely,
86.	Herein, the robe is any one of those beginning with the inner cloth. He uses: he
employs; dresses in [as inner cloth], or puts on [as upper garment]. Only [31] is a
phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a liniit28 of a purpose; the pmpose
in the meditator's making use of the robes is that much only, namely, protection
from cold, etc., not more than that. From cold: from any kind of cold arisen either
through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperatiue
externally. For protection: for the purpose of warding off; for the purpose of
eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body. For when the body is
afflicted by cold, the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted. That is why the
Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold. So in each
instance, except that from Jient means from the heat of fire, the origin of which
should be imderstood as forest fires, and so on.
87.	From contact with gadflies mid flies, wind and burning mid creeping things: here
gadflies are flies that bite; they are also called "blind flies." Flies are just flies. Wind
is distinguished as that with dust and that without dust. Bimiiiig is burning of the
sun. Creeping things are any long creatines such as snakes and so on that move by
crawling. Contact with them is of two kinds: contact by being bitten and contact

`32
by being touched. And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on. So he uses
it for the purpose of protection from such tilings.
88.	O///1/: the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable
purpose; for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose; the
others are purposes periodically. Herein, private parts are any parts of the
pudendum. For when a member is disclosed, conscience (hiri) is disturbed
(kuppati)f offended. It is called /yprivate parts" (ItirikopJna) because of the
disturbance of conscience (hiri-kopmta). For the purpose of concealing the private
parts: for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts. [As well as the
reading ^hiriko-pJna-paticchadanattham] there is a reading ^hirikopJnam
pnticchndanntthnm/'
89.	Alms food is any sort of food. For any sort of nutriment is called "alms food"
(piiidnpnta—lit. "liunp-dropping") because of its having been dropped (pntitnttn)
into a bhikklm's bowl durmg his alins rotuui (pindohja). Or aims food (pindnpntn) is
the dropping (pata) of the lumps (piuda); it is the concurrence (sannipntn), the
collection, of alms (bliikkJin) obtained here and there, is what is meant.
Neither for amusement: neither for the purpose of amusement, as with village
boys, etc.; for the sake of sport, is what is meant. Nor for intoxication: not for the
piupose of intoxication, as with boxers, etc.; for the sake of intoxication with strength
and for the sake of intoxication with manhood, is what is meant. [32] Nor for
smnrteiiiiig: not for the piupose of smartening, as with royal concubines, courtesans,
etc.; for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs, is what is meant. Nor for embellishment:
not for the purpose of embellishment, as with actors, dancers, etc.; for the sake of a
clear skin and complexion, is what is meant.
90.	And here the clause neither for amusement is stated for the purpose of
abandoning support for delusion; nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of
abandoning support for hate; nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the
purpose of abandoning support for greed. And neither for mmisement nor for
intoxication is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself.
Nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of preventing the
arising of fetters for another. And the abandoning of both unwise practice and
devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be imderstood as stated by these
four. Only has the meaning already stated.
91.	Of this body: of this material body consisting of the four great primaries. For
the endurance: for the purpose of continued endurance. And contiminnce: for the
piupose of not iiiterriiptmg [life's continued] occurrence, or for the purpose of
endurance for a long time. He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the
endurance, for the purpose of the continuance, of the body, as the owner of an old
house uses props for his house, and as a carter uses axle grease, not for the purpose
of amusement, intoxication, smartening, and embellishment. Furthermore,
endurance is a term for the life faculty. So what has been said as far as the words for
the endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean: for the purpose
of maintaining the occiurence of the life faculty in this body.
92.	For the ending of discomfort: hunger is called "discomfort" in the sense of
afflicting. He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that, like anointing
`33
a wound, like coimteiactiiig heat with cold, and so on. For assisting the life of purity:
for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation
and the life of purity consisting in the path. For while this [bhikkhu] is engaged in
crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings
depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food,
he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert
used their chilcTs flesh,29 just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft, and just as
those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship.
93. Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse nexv feelings: [33] thus as
a sick man uses medicine, he uses [alms food, thinking]: "By use of this alms food
I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger, and I shall not arouse a new feeling
by immoderate eating, like one of the [proverbial] brahmans, that is, one who eats
till he has to be helped up by hand, or till his clothes will not meet, or till he rolls
there [on the ground], or till crows can peck from his mouth, 01, tin til he vomits
what he has eaten. Or alternatively there is that which is called 'old feelings' because,
being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence on unsuitable
immoderate eating—I shall put a stop to that old feeling, forestallmg its condition
by suitable moderate eating. And there is that which is called 'new feeling' because
it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting
iii making improper use [of the requisite of alms food] now—I shall also not arouse
that new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root. This
is how the meaning should be imderstood here. What has been shown so far can
be imderstood to include proper use [of requisites], abandoning of devotion to
self-mortification, and not giving up lawful bliss (pleasure).
94. And I shall be healthy: "In this body which exists in dependence on requisites,
I shall, by moderate eating, have health called 'long	since there will be
no danger of severing the life faculty 01 interrupting the [continuity of the]
postures." [Reflecting] in this way, he makes use [of the alms food] as a sufferer
from a chronic disease does of his medicine. And blameless and live in comfort (lit.
"and have blamelessness and a comfortable abiding"): he makes use of them
thinking: "I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search, acceptance and
eating, and I shall have a conifortable abiding by moderate eating." Or he does so
thinking: "I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom,
sloth, sleepiness, blame by the wise, etc., that have imseemly immoderate eating as
their condition; and I shall have a comfoi table abiding by piodiiciiig bodily strength
that has seemly moderate eating as its condition." Or he does so thinking: "I shall
have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down, lolling and torpor,
through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly； and I shall
have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating foiu or
five mouthfuls less than the maximum." For this is said:
29. "Cliihfs flesli" (pmtta-mamsa) is an allusion to the story (SII98) of the couple who
set out to cross a desert with an insufficient food supply but got to the other side by
eating the flesh of their child who died on the way. The derivation given in PED, y/A
metaphor probably distorted from piitamai!is(i,〃 has no justification. The reference to
rafts might be to DII89.
`34
With four or five liunps still to eat
Let him then end by drinking water;
For energetic bhikkhus' needs
This should suffice to live in comfort (Th 983). [34]
Now, what has been shown at this point can be imderstood as discernment of
piupose and practice of the middle way.
95. Resting plnce (senasana): this is the bed (sena) and seat (asann). For wherever
one sleeps (seti), whether in a monastery or in a lean-to, etc., that is the bed (seun);
wherever one seats oneself (asati), sits (nisldati), that is the seat (nsmta). Both together
are called "resting-place" (or "abode"—senasana).
For the purpose ofumrdiiig off the perils of climnte and enjoi/ing retreat: the climate
itself in the sense of imperilling (parisahmta) is "perils of climate" (uhi-yarissaya).
Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction
can be warded off by making use of the resting place; it is for the piupose of warding
off these and for the piupose of the pleasure of solitude, is what is meant. Of
course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the phrase] "protection
from cold,〃 etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the
concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others
are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be imderstood as mentioned
with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or alternatively,
this "climate" of the kind stated is just climate; but "perils" are of two kinds: evident
perils and concealed perils (see Nidd 112). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers,
etcv while concealed perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and
reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do not,
owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, etc., cause
affliction, he can be imderstood as one who "reflecting wisely makes use of the
resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate."
96. The reqiiisite of medicine ns cure for the sick: here "cure" (jjnccnyn = going against)
is iii the sense of going against (pati-mjana) illness; in the sense of coimtei iiig, is the
meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man's work
(bhisnkkassn kammnni) because it is permitted by hiin, thus it is medicine (bJiesnjjn).
Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is "inedicine as cure for the sick." Any
work of a medical man such as oil, honey ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is
sick, is what is meant. A "i.equisite〃 (pnrikkharn), however, in such passages as "It is
well supplied with the requisites of a city" (A IV106) is equipment; in such passages
as "The chariot has the requisite of virtue, the axle of jhaiia, the wheel of energy,/
(S V 6) [35] it is an ornament; in such passages as "The requisites for the life of one
who has gone into homelessness that should be available" (M I 104), it is an
accessory. But here both equipment and accessory are applicable. For that medicine
as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by
preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life; and it is an accessory too
because it is an iiistnunent for prolonging life. That is why it is called "requisite."
So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a "requisite of
medicine as cure for the sick." [He makes use of] that requisite of medicine as cure
`35
lor the sick; any requisite tor liie consisting ol oil, honey, molasses, ghee, etc., that
is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick, is what is meant.
97.	From arisen: from born, become, produced. Hurtful: here "hurt (affliction)is
a disturbance of elements, and it is the leprosy tumours, boils, etc., originated by
that dishu’bance. Hurtful (ue\/i/nbnd1iikn) because arisen in the form of hurt (bi/nbndJin).
Feelings: painful feelings, feelings resulting from improfitable kaimna~from those
hurtful feelings. For complete immunity from affliction: for complete freedom from
pain; so that all that is painful is abandoned, is the meaning.
This is how this virtue concerning requisites should be understood. In brief its
chaiacteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection. The word-meaiiiiig here
is this: because breathing things go (m/anti), move, proceed, using [what they use]
in dependence on these robes, etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites
(yaccaya = ger. of pnti + m/ati); "concerning requisites" is concerning those requisites.
98.	(a) So, in this fourfold virtue, Patiinokklia restraint has to be undertaken by
means of faith. For that is accomplished by faith, since the aimoimcmg of training
precepts is outside the disciples' province; and the evidence here is the refusal of
the request to fallow disciples to] amioimce training precepts (see Vin III 9-10).
Having therefore imdertaken through faith the traiiimg precepts without exception
as announced, one should completely perfect them without regard for life. For
this is said: [36]
"As a hen guards her eggs,
Or as a yak her tail,
_Or like a darling child,_
Or like an only eye—
So you who are engaged
Your vii tue to protect,
Be prudent at all times
And ever scmpulous, (Source untraced)
Also it is said further: "So too, sire, when a training precept for disciples is
announced by me, my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life" (A IV
201).
99. And the story of the elders boiutd by robbers in the forest should be imderstood
iii this sense.
It seems that robbers in the MahavattanI Forest bound an elder with black
creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there for seven days he augmented
his insight, and after reaching the fruition of non-return, he died there and was
reborn in the Biahma-woild. Also they boirnd another elder m Tambapamii Island
(Sri Lanka) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire came
and the creepers were not cut, he established insight and attained Nibbana
sinudtaneously with his death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher of the Digha
Nikaya, passed by with five luindred bhikkhus, he saw [what had happened] and he
had the elder's body cremated and a shrine biiilt. Theiefoie let other clansmen also:
Maintain the rules of conduct pure,
Renoimciiig life if there be need,
`36
Rather than break virtue's restraint
By the World's Saviour decreed.
100.	(b) And as Patimokklia restraint is undertaken out of faith, so restraint of the
sense faculties should be imdertaken with mil id fulness. For that is accomplished by
mindfulness, because when the sense faculties' functions are founded on
mindfulness, there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the rest. So,
recollecting the Fire Discoiu se, which begins thus, "Better, bhikkhus, the extirpation
of the eye faculty by a red-hot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the
apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye" (S
IV 168), this [restraint] should be properly undertaken by preventing with
umemitting mindfulness any apprehension, in the objective fields consisting of
visible data, etc., of any signs, etc., likely to encourage covetousness, etc., to invade
consciousness occurriiig in connection with the eye door, and so on.
101.	[37] When not undertaken thus, virtue of Patimokkha restraint is
imenduriiig: it does not last, like a crop not fenced in with branches. And it is
raided by the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thieves. And
lust leaks into his mind as rain does into a badly-roofed house. For this is said:
"Among the visible objects, sotinds, and smells,
And tastes, and tangibles, guard the faculties;
For when these doors are open and imguarded,
Then thieves will come and raid as rtwere a village (?).
And just as with an ill-roofed house
The lain comes leaking in, so too
Will lust come leaking in for siue
Upon an imdeveloped mincT' (Dhp 13).
102.	When it is imdertaken thus, virtue of Patimokkha restraint is endLiriiig: it
lasts, like a crop well fenced in with branches. And it is not raided by the robber
defilements, as a village with well-guarded gates is not by thieves. And lust does
not leak into his mind, as rain does not into a well-roofed house. For this is said:
"Among the visible objects, soimds and smells,
And tastes and tangibles, guard the faculties;
For when these doors are closed and truly guarded,
Thieves will not come and raid as 'tweie a village (?).
"And just as with a well-roofed house
No rain comes leaking in, so too
No lust comes leaking in for siue
Upon a well-developed mind" (Dhp 14).
103.	This, however, is the teaching at its very highest.
This mind is called "quickly tiansfoimed" (A 110), so restraint of the faculties
should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness,
as was done by the Elder Vanglsa soon after he had gone forth. [38]
As the elder was wandering for alms, it seems, soon after going forth, lust arose
iii him on seeing a woman. Thereupon he said to the venerable Ananda:
`37
"I am afire with sensual lust.
And burnmg flames consume my mind;
In pity tell me, Gotama,
How to extinguish it for good" (S 1188).
The elder said:
"You do perceive mistakenly,
That burnmg flames consume your mind.
Look for no sign of beauty there,
For that it is which leads to lust.
See foulness there and keep yom, mind
Harmomously concentrated;
Formations see as alien,
As ill, not self, so this great lust
May be extinguished, and no more
Take fire thus ever and again" (S1188).
The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his aims round.
104.	Moreover, a bhikkhu who is fiilfillmg restraint of the faculties should be like
the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kiuandaka, and like the Elder
Maha Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of Coi’aka.
105.	In the Great Cave of Kuraiidaka, it seems, there was a lovely painting of the
Renimciation of the Seven Buddhas. A luunber of bhikkhus wandering about among
the dwellings saw the painting and said, "What a lovely painting, venerable sir!"
The elder said: "Foi more than sixty years, friends, I have lived in the cave, and I
did not know whether there was any painting there or not. Now, today, I know it
through those who have eyes." The elder, it seems, though he had lived there for so
long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave. And at the door of his
cave there was a great ironwood tree. And the elder had never looked up at that
either. He knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each year.
106.	The king heard of the elder's great virtues, and he sent for him three times,
desiring to pay homage to him. When the elder did not go, he had the breasts of all
the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off, [saying] "As long as the
elder does not come let the children go without milk," [39] Out of compassion for
the children the elder went to Mcdiagama. When the king heard [that he had come,
he said] "Go and bring the elder iii. I shall take the precepts." Having had him
brought up into the inner palace, he paid homage to him and provided him with a
meal. Then, saying, "Today, venerable sir, there is no opporttuiity. I shall take the
precepts tomorrow/' he took the elder's bowl. After following him for a little, he
paid homage with the queen and tiuned back. As seven days went by thus, whether
it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen, the elder said,
"May the king be happy/'
107.	Bhikkluis asked: "Why is it, venerable sir, that whether it is the king who
pays the homage or the queen you say yMay the king be happy?" The elder replied:
'Triends, I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen." At the end of seven
days [when it was found that:] the elder was not happy living there, he was dismissed
`38
by the king. He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraiidaka. When it was night he
went out onto his walk. A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a
torch of sticks. Then his meditation subject became quite clear and plain. The elder,
[thinking] "How clear my meditation subject is today!" was glad, and immediately
after the middle watch he reached Arahantship, making the whole rock resound.30
108.	So when another clansman seeks his own good:
Let him not be hiuigiy-eyed,
Like a monkey in the groves,
Like a wild deer in the woods,
Like a nervous little child.
Let him go with eyes downcast
Seeing a plough yoke's length before,
That he fall not in the power
Of the forest-monkey mind.
109.	The Elder Maha Mitta's mother was sick with a poisoned tiunoiu: She told
her daughter, who as a bliikkhiuii had also gone forth, "Lady, go to your brother.
Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicine./r She went and told him. The
elder said: "I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct
a medicine from them. But rather I will tell you a medicine: since I went forth I
have not broken fmy virtue of restraint of] the sense faculties by looking at the
bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind. By this [40] declaration of
truth may my mother get well. Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her body/' She
went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructed. At
that very moment the lay devotee's tumour vanished, shrinking awav like a lump
of froth. She got up and uttered a cry of joy: "If the Fully Enlightened One were
still alive, why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu
like my son?" So:
110.	Let another noble clansman
Gone forth in the Dispensation
Keep, as did the Elder Mitta,
Perfect faculty restramt.
111.	(c) As restraint of the faculties is to be imdertaken by means of inindhilness, so
livelihood purificntion is to be imdertaken by means of energy. For that is accomplished
by energy because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has
rightly applied energy Abandoning, therefore, luibefittiiig wrong search, this should
be luidertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on
aims roimd, etc., avoiding what is of iinpiue origin as though it were a poisonous
snake, and using only requisites of pure origin.
112.	Herein, for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices, any requisites obtained
from the Comnumity from a group of bliikkl'iiis, or from laymen who have confidence
in his special qualities of teaching the Dhaimna, etc., are called "of piue origin." But
30. Making the whole rock resound'\ 'making the whole rock reverberate as one doing
so by means of an earth tremor. But some say that is was owing to the cheering of the
deities who lived there"' (Visnvmht 58).
`39
those obtained on alms roiuui, etc., are of extremely piue oiigiii. For one who has
taken up the ascetic practices, those obtained on alms roiuid, etc., and—as long as this
is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practices—from people who have
confidence in his special qualities of asceticism, are called "of piue oiigin." And if he
has got putrid iirine with mixed gall nuts and "foLir-sweets"31 for the purpose of curing
a certain affliction, and he eats only the broken gall nuts, thinking, "Other companions
in the life of piuity will eat the 'foiir-sweets。" his luidertakiiig of the ascetic practices
is befitting, for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones' heritages
(A II28).
113.	As to the robe and the other requisites, no hint, indication, roundabout talk,
or intimation about robes and aims food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying
his livelihood. But a hint, indication, or roundabout talk about a resting place is
allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices. [41]
114.	Herein, a "hint" is when one who is getting the preparing of the groirnd,
etc., done for the purpose of [making] a resting place is asked, "What is being
done, venerable sir? Who is having it done?〃 and he replies, "No one〃； or any
other such giving of hints. An "indication" is saying, "Lay follower, where do you
live?"—〃In a mansion, venerable sir"—"But, lay follower, a mansion is not allowed
for bhikkhus.〃 Or any other such giving of indication. "Roundabout talk" is saying,
"The resting place for the Comnumity of Bhikkhus is crowded"; or any other such
oblique talk.
115.	All, however, is allowed in the case of medicine. But when the disease is
cured, is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine ob tamed in this way? Herein,
the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One,
therefore it is allowable. But the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no
offence, nevertheless the livelihood is sullied, therefore it is not allowable.
116.	But one who does not use hints, indications, roiuidabout talk, or intimation,
though these are permitted by the Blessed One, and who depends only on the
special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., and makes use onlv of requisites obtained
otherwise than by indication, etc., even when he thus risks his life, is called supreme
iii living in effacement, like the venerable Sariputta.
117.	It seems that the venerable one was ciiltivatmg seclusion at one time, living
iii a certain forest with the Elder Malta Moggallana. One day an affliction ot colic
arose in him, causing him great pain. In the evening the Elder Maha Moggallana
went to attend upon him. Seeing him lying down, he asked what the reason was.
And then he asked, "What used to make you better formerly friend?/r The elder
said, "When I was a layman, friend, my mother used to mix ghee, honey, sugar
and so on, and give me rice gruel with pure milk. That used to make me better.〃
Then the other said, "So be it, friend. If either you or I have merit, perhaps tomonow
we shall get some."
118.	Now, a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their
conversation. fTliiiikmgl "I will find rice gruel for the lord tomoi'i'ow," he went
31. "Foui-sweets〃~catumadhura: a medicinal sweet made of fom- ingredients: honey,
palin-sugar, ghee and sesame oil.
`40
meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder [42] and entered into the
body of the eldest son, causing him disconifort. Then he told the assembled relatives
the price of the cure: "If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the
elder, I will set this one free." They said: "Even without being told by you we
regularly supply the elder's needs," and on the following day they prepared rice
gruel of the kind needed.
119.	The Elder Malta Moggallana came in the morning and said, "Stay here, friend,
till I come back from the aims round." Then he went into the village. Those people
met him. They took his bowl, filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel, and
gave it back to him. The elder made as though to go, but they said, "Eat, venerable
sir, we shall give you more." When the elder had eaten, they gave him another
bowlful. The elder left. Bringing the alins food to the venerable Sariputta, he said,
"Here, friend Sariputta, eat." When the elder saw it, he thought, "The gruel is very
nice. How was it got?〃 and seeing how it had been obtained, he said, "Friend, the
alms food cannot be used."
120.	Instead of thinking, "He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me,〃
the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one side. As the
rice gruel fell on the groirnd the elder's affliction vanished. From then on it did not
appear again durmg forty-five years.
121.	Then he said to the venerable Maha Moggallana, "Fiiend, even if one's bowels
come out and trail on the ground, it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal
intimation,^ and he littered this exclamation:
My livelihood might well be blamed
If I were to consent to eat
The honey and the gruel obtained
By influence of verbal hints.
And even if my bowels obtrude
And trail outside, and even though
My life is to be jeopardized,
I will not blot my livelihood (Mil 370).
For I will satisfy my heart
By shiuming all wrong kinds of search;
And never will I imdertake
The search the Buddhas have condemned. [43]
122 And here too should be told the story of the Elder Maha Tissa the Maitgo-
eater who lived at Clragumba32 (see §132 below). So m all respects:
32. "The Elder Maha Tissa, it seems, was going on a joiuney diuiiig a famine, and
being tired in body and weak through lack of food and travel weariness, he lay down at
the root of a mango tree covered with fruit. There were many fallen mangoes here and
there" (Vism-mht 60). "Through ownerless mangoes were lying fallen on the groirnd
near him, he would not eat them in the absence of someone to accept them fiom" (Vism-
nilit 65). "Then a lay devotee, who was older than he, went to the elder, and learning of
his exhaustion, gave him mango juice to diink. Then he mounted him on his back and
`41
A man who has gone forth in faith
Should purify his livelihood
And, seeing clearly give no thought
To any search that is not good.
123.	(d) And as livelihood purification is to be Lmdertaken by means of energy
so virtue dependent on requisites is to be imdertaken by means of iinderstanding. For
that is accomplished by imderstandmg, because one who possesses imderstaiuimg
is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon
greed for requisites and imdertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully
and properly after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid.
124.	Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time of receiving requisites and at
the time of using them. For use (pnribliogn) is blameless in one who at the time of
receiving robes, etc., reviews them either as [mere] elements or as repulsive,33 and
puts them aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at the time of
using them.
125.	Here is an explanation to settle the matter. There are four kinds of use: use
as theft,34 use as a debt?, use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one
who is luwirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the
Comnumity is called "use as theft. Use withoat reviewing by one who is virtuous
is "use as a debt"; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and
the aims food lump by lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the
meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch.
If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the
position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed
each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of
medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses
it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is
mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.
126. Piuification is of four kinds: purification by the Teaching, purification by
restramt, piuification by search, and piuification by reviewing. Herein, virtue of
took him to his home. Meanwhile the elder admonished himself as follows: 'Nor your
mother nor your father/ etc. (see §133). And beginning the comprehension [of
formations], and augmenting insight, he realized Arahantship after the other paths in
due succession while he was still mounted on his back" (Vism-mht 60).
33.	u,As elements, in this way: 'This robe, etc., consists merely of [the four] elements
and occius when its conditions are present; and the person who uses it [likewise] / 'As
iii this way: Firstly perception of repiilsiveness in nutriment in the case of
aims food; then as bringing repiilsiveness to mind thus: 'But all these robes, etc., which
are not in themselves disgusting, become utterly disgusting on reaching this filthy
body"' (Vism-mht 61).
34.	'"Use as theft': use by one who is miwoithy. And the requisites are allowed by the
Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is virtuous, not imvirtnous; and the
generosity of the givers is towards one who is virtuous, not towards one who is not,
since they expect great fruit from their actions" (Vism-mht 61; cf. MN 142 and
coimnentary).
`42
the Patiinokklia restrniut is called "purification by the Teaching"; [44] for that is so
called because it purifies by means of teaching. Virtue of restrniut offaculties is called
^purification by lestiaint"; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the
restramt in the mental resolution, "I shall not do so again." Virtue of livelihood
ptirificntion is called "purification by search"; for that is so called because search is
purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and
properly. Virtue dependent on requisites is called '"piuification by reviewing"; for
that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described.
Hence it was said above (§125): "There is no offence for one who is mindful in
using after accepting without inindfulness."
127.	Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of tiaineis is called "use as an
inheritance"; for they are the Buddha's sons, therefore they make use of the
requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the
Blessed One's requisites or the laity's requisites that are used? Although given by
the laity they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the Blessed One
that they are peiinitted. That is why it should be imderstood that the Blessed One's
requisites are used. The confirmation here is in the Dhaimnadayada Sutta (MN 3).
Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called "use as a master"; for they
make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving.
128.	As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use as an inheiitance are
allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But
this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because
it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one
possessed of virtue is called a tramer too because of possessing this training.
129. As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a master is best, when a
bhikklui imdertakes virtue dependent on requisites, he should aspire to that and use
them after reviewing them in the way described. And this is said: [45]
"The truly wise disciple
Who listens to the Dhamma
As taught by the Sublime One
Makes use, after reviewing,
Of alms food, and of dwelling,
And of a resting place,
And also of the water
For washing dix t from l'obes" (Sn 391).
"So like a drop of water
Lying on leaves of lotus,
A bhikkhu is unsullied
By any of these matters,
By aims food, [and by dwelling,]
And by a resting place,
And also by the water
For washing dirt from robes'" (Sn 392).
`43
"Since aid it is and timely
Procured from another
The right ainoimt he reckons,
Mindful without remitting
In chewing and in eating,
In tasting food besides:
He treats it as an ointment
Applied upon a wound." (Source imtraced)
"So like the chilcTs flesh in the desert
Like the greasing for the axle,
He should eat without delusion
Nutriment to keep alive, (Source imtraced)
130. And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites
there should be told the story of the novice Sahgharakkliita the Nephew. For he
made use of requisites after reviewing, according as it is said:
"Seeing me eat a dish of rice
Quite cold, my preceptor observed:
'Novice, if you are not restrained,
Be careful not to burn your tongue/
On hearing my Preceptor's words,
I then and there felt urged to act
And, sitting in a single session,
_I reached the goal of Arahaiitsliip._
Since I am now waxed full in thought
Like the full moon of the fifteenth (M III 277),
And all my cankers are destroyed,
There is no more becoming now, [46]
And so should any other man
Aspiring to end siiffermg
Make use of all the requisites
Wisely after reviewing them.
So viitue is of four kinds as "virtue of Patimokkha restraint/7 and so on.
131. 18. In the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be
luuierstood in accordance with the vii tue of those not fully admitted to the Order,
and so on. For this is said in the Patisainbhida: "(a) What is virtue consisting in
limited purification? That of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to
the Order: such is virtue consisting in limited purification, (b) What is virtue
consisting in unlimited purification? That of the haining precepts for those fully
admitted to the Older: such is virtue consisting in lu'diiiiited purification, (c) What
is virtue consisting in fulfilled purification? That of magnanimous ordmaiy men
devoted to profitable things, who are perfecting [the comsel that ends in traineiship,
regardless of the physical body and life, having given up [attachment to] life: such is
virtue of fulfilled piuification, (d) What is virtue consisting m piuification not adhered
to? Tliat of tlie seven kinds of trainer: such is viitue consisting in piuification not adliered
to. (e) What is vii tue consisting in haiiqiiillized piuification? That of the Perfect One's
`44
disciples with cankers destroyed, of the Paccekabuddhas, ot the Perfect Ones,
accomplished and fully enlightened: such is virtue consisting in tranquillized
piuification7' (Patis 142-43).
132.	(a) Herein, the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be
imderstood as virtue consisting in limited purificntion, because it is limited by the
niunber [of tmining precepts, that is, five or eight or ten].
(b) That of those fully admitted to the Older is fdescribable] thus:
Nine thousand millions, and a luindred
And eighty millions then as well,
And fifty plus a hundred thousand,
And thirty-six again to swell.
The total restraint disciplines:
These rules the Enlightened One explains
Told under heads for filling out,
Which the Discipline restraint contains.35
So although limited in number, [47] it should yet be understood as virtue
consisting in iinlwiited purification, since it is undertaken without reserve and has
no obvious limit such as gain, fame, relatives, limbs or life. Like the virtue of the
Elder Malia Tissa the Mango-eatei who lived at Clragiunba (see §122 above).
133.	For that venerable one never abandoned the following good man's
recollection:
"Wealth for a soirnd limb's sake should be renounced,
And one who guards his life gives up his limbs;
And wealth and limbs and life, each one of these,
A man gives up who practices the Dhamma."
And he never transgressed a iraining precept even when his life was in the
balance, and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same vii tue of lu'diiiiited
purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotee's back.
According to as it is said:
"Nor your mother nor your father
Nor yoiir relatives and kin
Have done as much as this for you
Because you are possessed of virtue/'
So, stirred with urgency and wisely
Comprehending36 with insight,
35.	The figiues depend on whether koti is taken as 1,000,000 01 100,000 or 10,000.
36.	"Coinpi.ehending" (sammasana) is a technical term that will become clear in
Chapter XX. In short, it is inference that generalizes the "three characteristics" from
one's own directly-known experience to all possible formed experience at all times
(see S H 107). Commenting on “He comprehended that same ilhtess" (§138), Vism-mht
says: "He exercised insight by discerning the feeling in the illness imder the heading
of the feeling [aggregate] and the remaining material dhammas as materiality"
(Vism-mht 65).
`45
While carried on his helper's back
He reached the goal of Arahantship.
134.	(c) The magnanimous ordinary man's virtue, which from the time of
admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a [wrong] thought because of
its extreme purity like a gem of purest water, like well-refined gold, becomes the
proximate cause for Arahantship itself, which is why it is called consisting of fulfilled
ptirificntioii; like that of the lders Sangharakkliita the Great and Saiigharakkliita
the Nephew.
135.	The Elder Scuigharakkliita the Great {Matin SnngJiarakkJiita), aged over sixty
was lying, it seems, on his deathbed. The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about
attainment of the supranumdaiie state. The elder said: "I have no supianumdaiie
state." Then the yoimg bhikkhu who was attending on him said: "Venerable sir,
people have come as much as twelve leagues, thinking that you have reached
Nibbana. It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an oidinaiy man."—
"Friend, thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya, I did not try for insight. [48] So
help me to sit up and give me the chance." He helped the elder to sit lip and went
out. As he went out the elder reached Arahantsliip and he gave a sign by snapping
his fingers. The Order assembled and said to him: "Venerable sir, you have done a
difficult tiling in achieving the supianumdaiie state in the hoiu of death/'—"That was
not difficult, friends. But rather I will tell you what is difficult. Friends, I see no action
done [by me] without mindftdness and mikiiowmgly since the time I went forth." His
nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years.
136	._"Now, if a man has little learning_
And he is careless of his virtue,
They censure him on both accounts
For lack of virtue and of learnmg.
"But if he is of little learning
Yet he is careful of his virtue,
They praise him for his virtue, so
It is as though he too had learning.
"And if he is of ample learning
Yet he is careless of his virtue,
They blame him for his virtue, so
It is as though he had no learnmg.
"But if he is of ample learning
And he is careful of his virtue,
They give him praise on both accoimts
For vii tue and as well for learning.
"The Buddha's pupil of much learnmg
Who keeps the Law with imderstandmg—
A jewel of Jambu River gold37
Who is here fit to censure him?
37. A story of the Jambu River and its gold is given at M-a IV 147.
`46
Deities praise him [constantly!,
By Brahma also is he praised (A II 7).
137.	(d) What should be understood as virtue consisting in purification not adhered
to is trainers7 virtue, because it is not adhered to by [false] view, and ordmary
men's virtue when not adhered to by greed. Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the
Landowner's Son (Kutiimlm/nputtn-Tissn-thern). Wanting to become established in
Aiahantship in dependence on such virtue, this venerable one told his enemies:
I broke the bones of both my legs
To give the pledge you asked from me.
I am revolted and ashamed
At death accompanied by greed. [49]
"And after I had thought on this,
And wisely then applied insight,
When the sim rose and shone on me,
I had become an Aiahant" (M-a 1233).
138.	Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and imable to eat with
his own hand. He was writhing smeared with his own m ine and excrement. Seeing
him, a certain yoiing bhikklui said, "Oh, what a painful process life is!" The senior
elder told him: "If I were to die now, friend, I should obtain the bliss of heaven; I
have no doubt of that. But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like
the lay state obtained by disavowing the haining," and he added: "I shall die
together with my viitue." As he lay there, he comprehended that same illness
『with iiisightL and he reached Aiahaiitslilp. Having done so, he pronoiuiced these
verses to the Order of Bhikkhus:
"I am victim of a sickening disease
That racks me with its biuden of cruel pain;
As flowers in the dust burnt by the sun,
So this my corpse will soon have withered up.
"Unbeautiful called beautiful,
Unclean while reckoned as if clean,
Though full of ordure seeming fair
To him that cannot see it clear.
"So out upon this ailing rotting body,
Fetid and filthy punished with affliction,
Doting on which this silly generation
Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven!(J-a II437)
139.	(e) It is the viitue of the Arahants, etc., that should be understood as
tranquillized purification, because of tranqnillization of all disturbance and because
of piuifiedness.
So it is of five kinds as "consisting in limited piuification/7 and so on.
140.	19. In the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the
abandoning, etc., of killing living tilings, etc.; for this is said in the Patisainbhida:
"Five kinds of virtue: (1) In the case of killing living things, (a) abandoning is
`47
virtue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is virtue, (d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-
transgression is virtue. (2) In the case of taking what is not given ... (3) In the case
of sexual misconduct …（4) In the case of false speech …（5) In the case of malicious

(11) "丁hroiigh renimciation in the case of lust, (a) abandoning is virtue ... (12)

(15) Through definition of states (dhnmmn) ... uncertainty ... (16) Through

(18) "Through the first jhaiia in the case of the hindrances, (a) abandoning is viitue
.• • (19) Through the second jhaiia ... applied and sustained thought.. • (20) Through
the third jhaiia •.. happiness • • • (21) Through the fourth jhaiia in the case of pleasme

(26) "Through the contemplation of impeimanence in the case of the perception

dispassion in the case of the perception of delighting ... (30) Through the

(33) "Through the contemplation of destruction in the case of the perception of

[on formations] ... (42) Through reflection in the case of non-reflection ... (43)
Through the contemplation of turning away in the case of misinterpreting
(insistence) due to bondage ...
`48
(44) "Through the path of stream-entry in the case of defilements coefficient
with [false] view, (a) abandoning is virtue ... (45) Through the path of once-retum
iii the case of gross defilements ... (46) Through the path of non-return in the case
of residual defilements ... (47) Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all
defilements, (a) abandoning is vii tue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is virtue,
(d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-transgression is virtue.
"Such virtues lead to non-remorse in the mind, to gladdening, to happiness, to
haiiqiiillitY to joy to repetition, to development, to cultivation, to embeilishment, to
the requisite [for concentration!, to the equipment [of concentiation], to fulfilment, to
complete dispassion, to fading away to cessation, to peace, to direct-knowledge, to
eiilightemnent, to Nibb 如 a."38 (Patis 146-47)
141. And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere non-arisiiig
of the killing of living things, etc., as stated. But the abandoning of a given
[improfitable state] upholds [51] a given profitable state in the sense of providing a
foimdation for it, and concentrates it by preventing wavering, so it is called "virtue"
(siln) iii the sense of composing (silmia), reckoned as upholding and concentrating
as stated earlier (§19).
The other four tilings mentioned refer to the presence39 of occurrence of will as
abstention from such and such, as restraint of such and such, as the volition
associated with both of these, and as non-transgression in one who does not
transgress such and such. But their meaning of virtue has been explained already.
So it is of five kinds as "virtue consisting in abandoning" and so on.
142.	At this point the answers to the questions, "What is viitue? In what sense is
it virtue? What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?
Wliat are the benefits of vii tue? How many kinds of virtue are there?" are complete.
143.	However, it was also asked (vi) What is the defiling of it? and What is the
CLEANSING OF IT?
We answer that virtue's tornness, etc., is its defiling, and that its iintornness,
etc., is its cleansing. No\^ that tomness, etc., are comprised imder the breach that
has gain, fame, etc., as its cause, and imder the seven bonds of sexuality. When a
man has broken the tmining course at the beginning or at the end in any instance
of the seven classes of offences,40 his virtue is called torn, like a cloth that is cut at
the edge. But when he has broken it in the middle, it is called rent, like a cloth that
38.	This list describes, in terms of abandoning, etc., the stages in the normal progress
from ignorance to Arahantship, and it falls into the following groups: I. Virtue: the
abandoning of the ten improfitable courses of action (1-10). II. Concentration: A.
abandoning the seven hindrances to concentiation by means of their opposites (11-
17); B. The eight attainments of concentiation, and what is abandoned by each (18-25).
EH. Understanding: A. Insight: the eighteen piiiicipal insights beginning with the seven
contemplations (26-43). B. Paths: The foiu paths and what is abandoned by each (44rA7).
39.	Sabbhava—"presence" ( = sat + bhava): not in PED. Not to be coiiftised with snblmva—
"individual essence" ( = sa (Skr. sva) + bhava, or saha + bhava).
40.	The seven consisting of parajika, sanghadisesa, pacittiya, patidesamx/a, dukkata,
thullaccaya, dubbhasita (mentioned at M-a II33).
`49
is rent in the middle. When he has broken it twice 01 thrice in succession, it is
called blotched, like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a
discrepant colour appearing on the back or the belly. When he has broken it fall
over] at intervals, it is called mottled, like a cow speckled fall over] with discrepaiit-
coloiued spots at intervals. This in the first place, is how there comes to be tornness
with the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause.
144.	And likewise with the seven bonds of sexuality; for this is said by the Blessed
One: "Here, biahman, some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of pmity
rightly; for he does not [52] enter into actual sexual intercourse with women. Yet
he agrees to massage, maiiipillation, bathing and mbbiiig down by women. He
enjoys it, desires it and takes satisfaction in it. This is what is torn, rent, blotched
and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. This man is said to lead a life of
purity that is imcleait. As one who is boirnd by the bond of sexuality he will not be
released from birth, ageing and death ... he will not be released from siiffeiing, I
say.
145.	"Furthei'moie, biahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
jokes, plays and aimises liiinself with women ...
146.	"Furthei'moie, brahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
gazes and stares at women eye to eye ...
147.	"Furthei'moie, brahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
listens to the soiuid of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or
talk or sing or weep ...
148.	"Furtheimoie, bmhman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
recalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women ...
149.	"Furthei’moie, brahman, ... while he does not agree to [these things], [53]
yet he sees a householder or a householder's son possessed of, endowed with, and
indulging in, the five cords of sense desire ...
150.	'Turthermore, brahman, while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
leads the life of purity aspiring to some order of deities, fthiiikmg] Through this
rite (viitue) or this ritual (vow) or this asceticism I shall become a [great] deity or
some [lesser] deity/ He enjoys it, desires it, and takes satisfaction in it. This,
brahman, is what is torn, rent, blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of
piuity. This man ... will not be released from siiffermg, I say" (A IV 54-56).
This is how tomness, etc., should be understood as included under the breach
that has gain, etc., as its cause and imder the seven bonds of sexuality.
151 Untornness, however, is accomplished by the complete non-breakiiig of
the training precepts, by making amends for those broken for which amends shcndd
be made, by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality and, as well, by the non-
arisiiig of such evil things as anger, enmity contempt, doniineermg, envy avarice,
deceit, fraud, obduracy presiunption, pride (conceit), haughtiness, conceit (vanity),
and negligence (MN 7), and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes,
contentment, and effacement (MN 24).
`50
152.	Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, etc., and rectified by making
amends after being broken by the faults of negligence, etc., and not damaged by
the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity, are called
entirely mi tom, muent, imblotched, and luunottled. And those same virtues are
libernting since they bring about the state of a freeman, and praised by the wise
since it is by the wise that they are praised, and linadhered-to since they are not
adhered to by means of craving and views, and conducive to concentrntion since
they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentration. That is why
their untornness, etc., should be understood as "cleansing" (see also VELlOlf.).
153.	This cleansing comes about in two ways: through seeing the danger of failure
in vii tue, and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtue. [54] Herein, the danger
of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning,
"Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for the imvii tuous in the failure of virtue"
(A III 252).
154.	Furthermore, on account of his luwirtuousness an luwirtuous person is
displeasing to deities and hiunaii beings, is uninstmctable by his fellows in the life
of purity suffers when luwirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the
virtuous are praised. Owing to that luwirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth.
Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought
to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless because he causes no
great fruit fto accrue] to those who give him gifts. He is as hard to purify as a
cesspit many years old. He is like a log from a pyre (see It 99); for he is outside
both [recluseship and the lay state]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no
bhikklui, so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous,
like a mail who is everyone's enemy. He is as unfit to live with as a dead carcase.
Though he may have the qualities of learning, etc., he is as mifit for the homage of
his fellows in the life of purity as a charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans. He
is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing
a visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdom.
Though he fancies he is happy, yet he suffers because he reaps suffermg as told in
the Discourse on the Mass of Fiie (A IV 128-34).
155. Now^ the Blessed One has shown that when the imvii'tuous have their minds
captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the mdiilgence of the five cords of sense
desires, in [receiving] salutation, in being honoured, etc., the result of that kanuna,
directly visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that [kamma] as its condition,
capable of produciiig a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere
recollection of it. Here is the text:
"Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing?—
Yes, venerable sir.一What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one [gone
forth] should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burnmg, blazing
and glowing, 01 that he should sit down 01 lie down embracing a warrior-noble
maiden or a biahinan maiden 01 a maiden of householder family with soft, delicate
hands and feet?—It would be better, venerable sir, that he should sit down 01 lie
down embracing a warrior-noble maiden ... [55] It would be painful, venerable sir,
`51
li he sat down or lay down embracmg that great mass ol lire burmng, blazing and
glowing.
156.	"I say to you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus, that it would be better
for one [gone forth] who is imvii tuous, who is evil-natured, of unclean and suspect
habits, secretive of his acts, who is not an ascetic and claims to be one, who does
not lead the life of purity and claims to do so, who is rotten within, lecherous, and
full of corruption, to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire bm.ning,
blazing and glowing. Why is that? By his doing so, bhikklius, he might come to
death or deadly suffermg, yet he would not on that account, on the breakup of the
body after death, reappear in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in
hell. But if one who is imviituous, evil-natured ... and full of corruption, should
sit down or lie down embracmg a warrior-noble maiden ... that would be long for
his harm and siiffermg: on the break-up of the body after death, he would reappear
in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny in perdition, in hell〃 (A IV 128-29).
157.	Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of fiie the suffering
that is boimd lip with women and has as its condition the indulgence of the five
cords of sense desires fby the luwirtuousl, to the same intent he showed, by the
following similes of the horse-hair rope, the sharp spear, the iron sheet, the iron
ball, the iron bed, the iron chair, and the iron cauldron, the pain that has as its
condition [acceptance of] homage and reverential salutation, and the use of robes,
alms food, bed and chair, and dwelling [by luwirtuous bhikkhus]:
"What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a strong horse-
haii' rope twisted roiuid both legs by a strong man and tightened so that it cut through
the outer skin, and having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin, and
having cut through the inner skin, it cut through the flesh, and having cut through the
flesh it cut through the sinews, and having cut through the sinews it cut through the
bones, and having cut through the bones it remained cmshing the bone marrow~or
that he should consent to the homage of great wairior-nobles, great bralunaiis, great
householders?" (A IV 129). [56]
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have a
strong man woirnd one's breast with a sharp spear tempered in oil~01 that he
should consent to the reverential salutation of great wairior-nobles, great biahmans,
great householders?" (A IV 130).
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's body should be
wrapped by a strong man in a red-hot iron sheet burmng, blazing and glowing—
or that he should use robes given out of faith by great warrioi-nobles, great
brahmans, great householders?" (A IV 130-31).
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's mouth should
be prised open by a strong man with red-hot iron tongs bmnmg, blazing and
glowing, and that into his mouth should be put a red-hot iron ball Luuning, blazing
and glowing, which bians his lips and biuns his mouth and tongue and throat: and
belly and passes out below carrying with it his bowels and entrails~or that he should
use alms food given out of faith by great Wcurior-nobles …？"（A IV 131-32).
`52
And: "What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a strong
man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and seat him or lay him on a
red-hot iron bed or iron chair, biuiiiiig, blazing and glowing~or that he should use a
bed or chair given out of faith by great warrior-nobles …？"（A IV 132-33).
And: "What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a
strong man take him feet up and head down and plimge him into a red-hot metal
cauldron burning, blazing and glowing, to be boiled there in a swirl of fioth, and as
he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept now up, now down, and now across~or that
he should use a dwelling given out of faith by great wairior-nobles …？" (A IV133-34).
158.	What pleasure has a man of broken virtue
Forsaking not sense pleasiues, which bear fruit
Of pain more violent even than the pain
In the embracing of a mass of fiie?
What pleasure has he in accepting homage
Who, having failed in virtue, must partake
Of pain that will excel in agony
The cmshing of his legs with horse-hair ropes? [57]
What pleasure has a man devoid of virtue
Accepting salutations of the faithful,
Which is the cause of pain acuter still
Than pain produced by stabbing with a spear?
What is the pleasure in the use of garments
For one without restraint, whereby in hell
He will for long be forced to luidergo
The contact of the blazing iron sheet?
Although to him his alms food may seem tasty,
Who has no virtue, it is direst poison,
Because of which he surely will be made
For long to swallow burmng iron balls.
And when the vii tueless make use of couches
And chairs, though reckoned pleasing, it is pain
Because they will be tortmed long indeed
On red-hot blazing iron beds and chairs.
Then what delight is there for one unvirhious
Inhabiting a dwelling given in faith,
Since for that reason he will have to dwell
Shut up inside a blazing iron pan?
The Teacher of the world, in him condemning,
Described him in these terms: "Of suspect habits,
Full of corruption, lecherous as well,
By nature evil, rotten too within."
So out upon the life of him abiding
Without restraint, of him that wears the guise
`53
Of the ascetic that he will not be,
And damages and imdermines himself!
What is the life he leads, since any person,
No matter who, with virtue to his credit
Avoids it here, as those that would look well
Keep far away from dung or from a corpse?
He is not free from any sort of terror,
Though free enough from pleasure of attainment;
While heaven's door is bolted fast against him,
He is well set upon the road to hell.
Who else if not one destitute of virtue
More fit to be the object of compassion?
Many indeed and grave are the defects
That brand a man neglectful of his virtue.
Seeing danger in the failure of virtue should be imderstood as reviewing in
such ways as these. And seeing benefits in perfected vii-tue should be imderstood
in the opposite sense.
159. Furthermore: [58]
His virtue is immaculate,
His wearing of the bowl and robes
Gives pleasure and inspires trust,
His going forth will bear its fruit.
A bhikkhu in his vii tue pure
Has never fear that self-reproach
Will enter in his heart: indeed
There is no darkness in the sm\.
A bhikkhu in his virtue bright
Shines forth in the Ascetics' Wood41
As by the brightness of his beams
The moon lights up the firmament.
Now, if the bodily perfiune
Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeed
In pleasing even deities,
What of the perfume of his viitue?
It is more perfect far than all
The other perfiunes in the world,
Because the perfiune virtue gives
Is borne imchecked in all directions.
The deeds done for a virtuous man,
Though they be few, will bear much fruit,
41. An allusion to the Gosiiiga Suttas (MN 31, 32).
`54
And so the virtuous man becomes
A vessel of honour and renown.
There are no cankers here and now
To plague the virtuous man at all;
The virtuous man digs out the root
Of suffermg in lives to come.
Perfection among human kind
And even among deities.
If wished for, is not hard to gain
For him whose vii tue is perfected;
But once his virtue is perfected,
His mind then seeks no other kind
han the perfection of Nibbana,
The state where utter peace prevails.
Such is the blessed fruit of virtue,
Showing full many a varied form,
So let a wise man know it well
This root of all perfection's branches.
160. The mind of one who imderstands thus, shudders at failure in viitue and
reaches out towards the perfecting of vii tue. So vii tue should be cleansed with all
care, seeing this danger of failure in viitue and this benefit of the perfection of
vii tue in the way stated.
161. And at this point in the Path of Purification, which is shown under the headings
of virtue, concentration and understanding by the stanza, "When a wise man,
established well in virtue" (§1), virtue, firstly, has been fully illustrated.

Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
(Dhutaiiga-niddesa)
1.	[59] Now, while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of virtue, he should set
about imdertakiiig the ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities
of fewness of wishes, contentment, etc., by which the virtue of the kind already
described, is cleansed. For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the
waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement,
seclusion, dispersal, energy and modest needs, it will become quite purified; and
his vows will succeed as well. And- so, when his whole behavioiu has been piuified
by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established
in the [first] three of the ancient Noble Ones' heritages, he may become worthy to
attain to the fourth called /ydelight in development" (A II 27). We shall therefore
begin the explanation of the ascetic practices.
[The 13 kinds of Ascetic Practices]
2.	Tliirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to
clansmen who have given lip the things of the flesh and, regardless of body and
Iite, are desirous of undertaking a practice in confoimity [with their aim]. They

(3) The imdertakiiig and directions,
`56
And then the grade, and breach as well,
And benefits of each besides,
(4)	As to the profitable triad,
(5)	"Ascetic" and so on distmgiiished,
(6)	And as to groups, and also (7) singly,
The exposition should be known. [60]
4. 1. Herein, as to meaning, in the first place.
i.	It is "refuse” (pmnsiikfiln) since, owing to its being found on refuse in any
such place as a street, a charnel groirnd, or a midden, it belongs, as it were, to the
refuse in the sense of being diunped in anyone of these places. Or alternatively：
like refuse it gets to a vile state (PAMSU viya KUcchitabhavmn ULAti), thus it is
"refuse" (pamsuktlln); it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of a
refiise-fragl, which has acquired its derivative name1 in this way is "i,efuse-[i'ag-
wearing]" (patnsnkula). That is his habit, thus he is a ^refuse-frag-wear-Jei^
{pmnsukulika). The practice (anga) of the ref use- f rag-wear-1er is the ^refuse-frag-
weai-]er's practice" (ymnsiikulikaiiga). It is the action that is called the "practice."
Therefore it should be imderstood as a term for that by undertaking which one
becomes a refuse- fi ag-wear-] er.
ii.	In the same way, he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe (ti-cwara)—in
other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the innei clothing—
other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the inner clothing—
thus he is a "hiple-robe-fweai-lei" (tecwarika). His practice is called the 7/triple-
robe-wearer's practice/'
5.	iii. The dropping (patn) of the lumps (pinda) of material sustenance (njnisn)
called alms (bhikkJin) is "alms food" (pindnpntn); the falling (nipntmm) into the bowl
of liunps (yinda) given by others, is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that
falling of lumps), he seeks it by approaching such and such a family, thus he is
called an "alms-food [eat-]er" (yindnpntikn). Or his vow is to gather (pntituin)2 the
lump (p)iiidn)f thus he is a "liunp-gatherer" (piiidnpntin). To "gather” is to wander
for. A "liunp-gathei.ei." (pindnpntin) is the same as an "alms-food-eater" (pindnpntikn).
The practice of the alins-food-eater is the "alins-food-eater's practice/'
6.	iv. It is a hiatus (nimkhnndana) that is called a "gap" (dana).3 It is removed (apeta)
from a gap, thus it is called "gapless" (npadmin); the meaning is, it is without hiatus.
It is together with (saha) what is gapless (npcidmw), thus it is "with the gapless"
(snpndmin); devoid of hiatus—from house to house—is what is meant. His habit is
to wander on what:-is-wit:lvthe-gapless, thus he is a "gapless wanderei ^ (snpndniin-
carin). A gapless wanderer is the same as a "house-to-house-seekei," (snpndnnn-
carikn). His practice is the ''hoiise-to-hoiise-seekei rs practice/'
7.	v. Eating in one session is "one-session." He has that habit, thus he is a "one-
sessionei." His practice is the "one-sessionei's practice/'
1.	Nibbacana—"derivative name (or verbal derivative)"; grain, term not in PED; M-a I
61,105; Vism XVI.16.
2.	Patati—"to gather (or to wander)": not in PED.
3.	Avakltandana—"hiatus" and dana—"gap": not in PED.
`57
vi. Alins (piudii) in one bowl (pnttn) only because of ref using a second vessel, is
"bowl-alms" (pnttn-piudn). Now, making "bowl alms" (pnttn-piiiiin) the name for
the taking of aims food in the bowl: bowl-alms-tood is his habit, thus he is a "bowl-
tood-eater〃 (imttnpintiikn). His practice is the "bowl-food-eater's practice."
8.	vii. "No〃 (kJiahi) is a particle in the sense of retusing. [61] Food (bhntta) obtained
later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called "later-food〃 (yncchn-bhnttn).
The eating of that later food is "latei-food-eating." Making "latei’-food〃 (pnccha-
bhntta) the name for that later-food-eatmg: later-food is his habit, thus he is a "latei-
food-[eat-]er〃 (pncchnbhnttika). Not a later-food-eater is a "no-latei-food-[eat-】er〃
(khnlu-pncchnbhnttikn), [that is, a ^later-food-refuserr/]. This is the name for one who
as an undertaking refuses extra food. But it is said in the commentary4 "Khalu is a
certain kind of bird. When it has taken a fniit into its beak and that drops, it does
not eat any more. This [bhikkhu] is like that." Thus he is "a latei -food-r ef user/r
(klinlii-paccha-bhattikn). His practice is the 'latei-food-refuser's practice."
9.	viii. His habit is dwelling in the forest, thus he is a "forest-dwellei,.〃 His practice
is the "torest-dweller's practice/7
ix.	Dwelling at the root of a tree is "h,ee-i,oo卜dwelling." He has that habit, thus
he is a ntree-root-dweller.n The practice of the tree-root-dweller is the "tree-ioot-
dweller's practice."
x.,	xi. Likewise with the open-aii-dweller and the charnel-groiuid-dweller.
10.	xii. Only what has been distributed (ynd eva santhntn) is "as distributed"
(yathasanthntn). This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus "This one falls
to you." He has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed, thus he is an "as-
disti,ibiited-usei'〃 (\/nthasant1intika), [that is, an "any-bed-usei,"]. His practice is the
"any-bed-user's practice."
xiii. He has the habit of keeping to the sitting [posture when resting], retusing
to lie down, thus he is a "sitter." His practice is the "sitter's practice."
11.	All these, however, are the practices (anga) of a bhikkhu who is ascetic (dhutn)
because he has shaken off (dhiita) defilement by tindei taking one 01 other of them.
Or the knowledge that has got the name “ascetic" (dhtitn) because it shakes off
(dltunann) defilement is a practice (anga) belonging to these, thus they are "ascetic
practices" (dJnitnngn). Or alternatively they are ascetic (dlmta) because they shake
off (niddlnuimia) opposition, and they are practices (anga) because they are a way
(patipatti).
This, firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning.
12.	2. All of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertaking. For this
is said [in the conunentaiy]: "He who does the undertaking is a person. That
whereby he does the undertaking is states of consciousness and consciousness-
conconiitaiits. The volition of the act of tindei taking is the ascetic practice. What it
rejects is the instance." All have the fiuiction of eliminating cupidity and they

longer extant, from which Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa drew his material.
`58
manifest themselves with the production of non-cupidity. For their proximate cause
they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes, and so on. [62] This is
how the exposition should be known ns to cJinrncteristic, etc” here.
13.	3. As regards the five beginning with the undertnking and directions: diuing
the Blessed One's lifetime all ascetic practices should be Lmdertaken in the Blessed
One's presence. After his attainment of Nibbana this should be done in the presence
of a principal disciple. When he is not available it should be done in the presence
of one whose cankers are destroyed, of a non-retiuner, of a once-returner, of a
stream-enterer, of one who knows the three Pitakas, of one who knows two of the
Pitakas, of one who knows one of the Pitakas, of one who knows one Collection,5
of a teacher of the Commentaries. When he is not available it should be done in the
presence of an observer of an ascetic practice. When he is not available, then after
one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be imdertaken seated in a reverential
posture as though pronoimcmg them in the Fully Enlightened One's presence.
Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneself.
And here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were
elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic
practices6 (M-a II140).
This, firstly is what applies to all [the practices].
14.	Now, we shall proceed to comment on the undertaking, directions, grade,
breach and benefits, of each one [separately].
i. First, the reftise-rng-zuenre/s practice is imdertaken with one of these two
statements: "I refuse robes given by householders" or "I imdertake the refuse-rag-
weai’ei's practice/7 This, firstly is the undertnking.
15.	One who has done this should get a robe of one of the followmg kinds: one
from a charnel groiuid, one from a shop, a cloth from a street, a cloth from a niidden,
one from a childbed, an ablution cloth, a cloth from a washing place, one worn
going to and retiunmg from [the charnel groiuui], one scorched by fiie, one gnawed
by cattle, one gnawed by ants, one gnawed by rats, one cut at the end, one cut at the
edge, one carried as a flag, a robe from a shrine, an ascetic's robe, one from a
consecration, one produced by supernormal power, one from a highway, one borne
by the wind, one presented by deities, one from the sea. Taking one of these robe
cloths, he should tear off and throw away the weak parts, and then wash the soiuid
parts and make up a robe. He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by
householders.
16.	Herein, “one from a charnel ground" is one dropped on a charnel ground.
5.	one who knows one of the five collections (nikaya) beginning with
the Collection of Long Discourses (Digha Nikaya). (Vism-nilit 76)"
6.	"That elder, it seems, was a sitter, but no one knew it. Then one night the other saw
him by the light of a flash of lightning sitting up on his bed. He asked, 'Are you a sitter,
venerable sir?' Out of fewness of wishes that his ascetic practice should get known, the
elder lay down. Afterwards he imdeitook the practice anew. So the story has come
down. (Vism-nilit 77)"
`59
"Oiie from a shop" is one dropped at the door of a shop.
nA cloth from a street" is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by
those who seek merit.
nA clotli from a midden" [63] is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbish.
“One from a chndbecT is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of
childbirth with it. The mother of Tissa the Minister, it seems, had the stains of
childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a himdred [pieces], and thinking, "The
refuse-rag wearers will take it,〃 she had it thrown onto the Talaveli Road.7 Bhikkhus
took it for the piupose of mending worn places.
17. ''An ablution cloth" is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe
themselves, including their heads, are accustomed to throw away as a "cloth of ill
luck."
nA clot J i from washing plnce/r is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing
is done.
"Oiie zoom going to mid coming from" is one that people throw away after they
have gone to a charnel groirnd and retiuned and bathed.
"Otie scorched by fire” is one partly scorched by fire; for people throw that away.
"Oiie gnawed by cattle/, etc., are obvious; for people throw away such as these
"Oue carried ns a flagf/: Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flag. It is
allowable to take this when they have gone out of sight. Also it is allowable, when
the two armies have gone away, to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefield.
18.	°A robe from a shrine" is an offering made by draping a terniite-moiuui fin
cloth].
''An ascetic's robe" is one belonging to a bhikkhu.
"One from a consecrationn is one thrown away at the king's consecration place.
"One produced by supernormal power" is a //come-bhikkhii// robe.8 "One from a
highway” is one dropped in the middle of a road. But one dropped by the owner's
negligence should be taken only after waiting a while.
"One borne by the windn is one that falls a long way off, having been carried by
the wind. It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sight.
"One presented by deities" is one given by deities like that given to the Elder
Aiuiruddlia (Dhp-a II173-74).
"Oiie from the sen” is one washed up on dry land by the sea waves.
19.	One given thus "We give it to the Order" or got by those who go out for alins-
cloth is not a refuse-rag. And in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu, one given
7.	'The name of a street in Mahagama (S.E. Sri Lanka). Also in Anmadl'iapiira, they
say" (Vism-mht 77).
8.	On certain occasions, when the going forth was given by the Buddha with only the
words, "Elii bhikkhu (Come, bhikkhu)," owing to the disciple's past merit robes appealed
miiaciilously upon liim (see e.g. Vin Mahavagga, Kh. 1).
`60
after it has been got fat a presentation of robes by householders] at the end of the|
Rains, or a "resting-place i,obe〃 [that is, one automatically supplied by a householder
to the occupant of a certain resting place] is not a refuse-rag. It is a refuse-rag only
when given after not having been so obtained. And herein, that placed by the donors
at a bhikkhu's feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuse-rag wearer by placing it
iii his hand is called pure in one way. That given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his
hand but placed by him at the frefuse-rag wearer's] feet is also piue in one way.
That which is both placed at a bhikkhii's feet and then given by him m the same
way is pure in both ways. [64] One obtained by being placed in the hand and
[given by beingl placed in the hand too is not a strict inan's robe. So a refuse-rag
wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuse-rags.
These are the directions for it in this instance.
20.	The grades are these. There are three kinds of refiise-rag wearers: the strict, the
medium, and the mild. Herein, one who takes it only from a charnel groirnd is strict.
One who takes one left fby someone, thinkingl "One gone forth will take it" is mediiun.
One who takes one given bv being placed at his feet fby a bhikkhu] is mild.
The moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to [accept]
a robe given by a householder, his ascetic practice is broken. This is the breach in
this instance.
21.	The benefits are these. He actually practices in confoimity with the dependence,
because of the words "The going forth by depending on the refuse-rag robe" (Vin
158,96); he is established in the first of the Noble Ones' heritages (A II27); there is
no suffering due to protecting; he exists independent of others; there is no fear of
robbers; there is no craving connected with use [of robes]; it is a requisite suitable
for an ascetic; it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus "valueless,
easy to get, and blameless" (A II 26); it inspires confidence; it produces the fmits
of fewness of wishes, etc.; the right way is cultivated; a good example is set9 to later
generations.
22.	While striving for Death's aiiny's rout
The ascetic clad in mg-iobe clout
Got from a rubbish heap, shines bright
As mail-clad warrior in the fight.
This robe the world's great teacher wore,
Leaving rare Kasi cloth and more;
Of rags from off a rubbish heap
Who would not have a robe to keep?
Minding the words he did profess
When he went into homelessness,
Let him to wear such rags delight
As one in seemly garb bedight.
This, firstly is the commentary on the imdertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and benefits, in the case of the refuse-rag-wearer's practice.
9. Apmdaiia—"institution (or production),〃 not in PED.
`61
23.	ii. Next there is the triyle-robe-wearers practice. This is undertaken with one
of the following statements: "I refuse a fourth iobe〃 or "I imdertake the triple-
robe-wearer's practice/7 [65]
When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, he can put it by for as long
as, owing to ill-health, he is imable to make it up, or for as long as he does not find
a helper, or lacks a needle, etc., and there is no fault in his putting it by. But it is not
allowed to put it by once it has been dyed. That is called cheating the ascetic practice.
These are the directions for it.
24.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict should, at the time ot dyeing,
first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment, and having dyed it, he should
wear that roimd the waist and dye the other. Then he can put that on over the
shoulder and dye the cloak of patches. But he is not allowed to wear the cloak of
patches roimd the waist. This is the duty when in an abode inside a village. But it
is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two together. However, he should
sit iii a place near fto the robes] so that, if he sees anyone, he can pull a yellow cloth
over himself. But for the mediiun one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for
use while dyeing, and it is allowable for him to wear that [as an inner cloth] or to
put it on fas an upper garment] in order to do the work of dyeing. For the mild one
it is allowable to wear, or put on, the robes of bhikkhus who are in coimnimion (i.e.
not suspended, etc.) in order to do the work of dyeing. A bedspread that remains
where it is10 is also allowable for him, but he must not take it about him. And it is
allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in
communion. It is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to
have a yellow shoulder-cloth too as a fourth; but it nuist be only a span wide and
three hands long.
The moment anyone of these three agrees to [accept] a fourth robe, his ascetic
practice is broken. This is the breach in this instance.
25.	The benefits are these. The bhikkhu who is a triple-robe wearer is content
with the robe as a protection for the body. Hence he goes taking it with him as a
bird does its wings (M1180); and such special qualities as having few Lmdertakmgs,
avoidance of storage of cloth, a frugal existence, the abandoning of greed for many
robes, living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted,
production of the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc., are perfected. [66]
26.	No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit
Who wants no extra cloth for requisite;
Using the triple robe where'er he goes
The pleasant relish of content he knows.
10. Tntratthaka-paccattharana—"a bedspread that remains there"; "A name for what
has been determined upon as a bedspread in one's own resting place or in someone
else's. They say accordingly (it is said in a commentary) that there is no breach of the
ascetic practice even when these two, that is, the bedspread and the luuiyed cloth, are
kept as extra lobes" (Vism-nil'it 78-79). For tatratthaka (fixture) see also §61.
`62
So, would the adept wander undeterred
With naught else but his robes, as flies the bird
With its own wings, then let him too rejoice
That frugaliiess m garments be his choice.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the triple-robe-wearer's practice.
27.	iii. The alms-food-ente/s practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse a supplementaiy [food] supply" 01 "I imdertake the alins-
food-eatei's practice."
Now, this alms-food eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds ot
meal: a meal offered to the Order, a meal offered to specified bhikkhus, an invitation,
a meal given by a ticket, one each half-moon day one each Uposatha day one each
first of the half-moon, a meal given for visitors, a meal for travellers, a meal for the
sick, a meal for sick-iuuses, a meal supplied to a [particular] residence, a meal
given in a principal house,11 a meal given in turn.
If, instead of saying "Take a meal given to the Older", [meals] are given saying
"The Order is taking alms in our house; you may take alms too", it is allowable to
consent. Tickets from the Older that are not for actual food,12 and also a meal
cooked iii a monastery, are allowable as well.
These are the directions for it.
28.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict takes alms brought both
from before and from behind, and he gives the bowl to those who take it while he
stands outside a door. He also takes alms brought to the refectory and given there.
But he does not take alms by sitting [and waiting for it to be brought later] that day.
The medium one takes it as well by sitting [and waiting for it to be brought later]
that day; but he does not consent to fits being brought] the next day. The mild one
consents to aims [being brought] on the next day and on the day after. Both these
last miss the joy of an independent life. There is, perhaps, a preaching on the Noble
Ones' heritages (A II 28) in some village. The strict one says to the others "Let us
go, friends, and listen to the Dhamma." One of them says, "I have been made to sit
[and wait] by a man, venerable sir, and the other, "I have consented to [receive]
alms tomorrow, venerable sir." So they are both losers. The other wanders for alms
iii the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the Dhamma. [67]
The moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of a meal
given to the Order, etc., his ascetic practice is broken. This is the breach in this
instance.
29. The benefits are these. He actually practices in conformity with the dependence
because of the words "The going forth by depending on the eating of lumps of
11.	"A meal to be given by setting it out in a piiiicipal house only." (Vism-nilit 79)
This meaning of dhurn-bhatta not in PED.
12.	"Tickets that are not for actual food, but deal with medicine, etc." (Vism-mlit 79)
Pntikknmana一"refectory” (28) = bojun hal (eating hall) in Sinhalese translation.
`63
aims food" (Vin II 58, 96); he is established in the second of the Noble Ones'
heritages; his existence is independent of others; it is a requisite reconunended by
the Blessed One thus "Valueless, easy to get, blameless" (A II 26); idleness is
eliminated; livelihood is purified; the practice of the minor traii'iiiig rule [of the
Patimokkha] is fulfilled; he is not maintained by another; he helps others; pride is
abandoned; craving for tastes is checked; the haining precepts about eating as a
group, substituting one meal [invitation for another] (see Vinaya, Pacittiya 33 and
Corny.), and good behavioiu*, are not contravened; his life conforms to [the principles
of| fewness of wishes; he cultivates the right way; he has compassion for later
generations.
30.	The monk content with aims for food
Has independent livelihood,
And greed in him no footing finds;
He is as free as the four winds.
He never need be indolent,
His livelihood is innocent,
So let a wise man not disdain
Alins-gatheriiig for his domain.
Since it is said:
"If a bhikklui can support himself on alms
And live without another's maintenance,
And pay no heed as well to gam and fame,
The very gods indeed might envy him" (Ud 31).
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach and
benefits, in the case of the alms-food-eater's practice.
31.	iv. The hoiise-to-hoiise seeker,s practice is undertaken with one of the followmg
statements "I refuse a greedy alms l’otind" or "I Luuiertake the house-to-house
seeker's practice/'
Now, the house-to-house seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure
that there is no danger. If there is danger in any street 01 village, it is allowable to
leave it out and wander for alins elsewhere. When there is a house door 01 a street
or a village where he [regularly] gets nothing at all, he can go [past it] not counting
it as a village. But wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed [subsequently]
to go [past] there and leave it out. This bhikkhu should enter the village early so
that he will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhere. [68] But
if people who are giving a gift [of a ineal] in a monastery or who are coming along
the road take his bowl and give alms food, it is allowable. And as this [bhikkhu] is
going along the road, he should, when it is the time, wander for alms in any village
he comes to and not pass it by. If he gets nothing there or only a little, he should
wander for alins in the next village in order. These are the directions for it.
32.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict does not take aims brought
from before 01 brought from behind 01 brought to the refectory and given there.
He hands over his bowl at a door, however; for in this ascetic practice there is none
equal to the Elder Malia Kassapa, yet an instance in which even he handed over his
`64
bowl is mentioned (see Ud 29). The medium one takes what is brought from before
and from behind and what is brought to the refectory and he hands over his bowl
at a door. But he does not sit waiting for alms. Thus he conforms to the rule of the
strict alms-food eater. The mild one sits waiting [foi alms to be brought] that day.
The ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms round
starts [by going only to the houses where good alms food is given]. This is the
breach in this instance.
33.	The benefits are these. He is always a stranger among families and is like the
moon (SII197); he abandons avarice about families; he is compassionate impartially;
he avoids the dangers in being supported by a family； he does not delight in
invitations; he does not hope for [meals] to be brought; his life conforms to [the
principles of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
34.	The monk who at each house his begging plies
Is moonlike, ever new to families,
Nor does he grudge to help all equally
Free from the risks of house-dependency.
Who would the self-indulgent round forsake
And roam the world at will, the while to make
His downcast eyes range a yoke-length before,
Then let him wisely seek from door to door.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the house-to-house-seeker's practice. [69]
35.	v. The one-sessioner s practice is undertaken with one of the followmg statements:
"I refuse eating in several sessions" or "I imdertake the one-sessioner's practice."
When the one-sessioner sits down in the sitting hall, instead of sitting on an
elder's seat, he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and sit down on
that. If his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is still imfiiiished, it is
allowable for him to get up and do the duties. But the Elder Tipitaka Cilia-Abhaya
said: "He should either keep his seat [and finish his meal] or [if he gets up he
should leave the rest of] his meal [in order not to break the ascetic practice]. And
this is one whose meal is still unfinished; therefore let him do the duties, but in
that case let him not eat the [rest of the] meal." These are the directions.
36.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict may not take anything
more than the food that he has laid his hand on whether it is little 01 much. And if
people bring him ghee, etc., thinking "The elder has eaten nothing," while these
are allowable for the purpose of medicine, they are not so for the purpose of food.
The medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not exhausted;
for he is called "one who stops when the food is finished." The niild one may eat
as long as he does not get lip from his seat. He is either "one who stops with the
water" because he eats until he takes [water foi] washing the bowl, or "one who
stops with the session" because he eats imtil he gets up.
The ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been
eaten at more than one session. This is the breach in this instance.
`65
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
37.	The benefits are these. He has little affliction and little sickness; he has lightness,
strength, and a happy life; there is no contravening [rules] about food that is not
what is left over from a meal; craving for tastes is eliminated; his life conforms to
the [principles of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
38.	No illness due to eating shall he feel
Who gladly in one session takes his meal;
No longing to indulge his sense of taste
Tempts him to leave his work to go to waste.
His own true happiness a monk may find
In eating in one session, pure in mind.
Purity and effacement wait on this;
For it gives reason to abide in bliss.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, prades. breach, and
benefits, in the case of the one-sessioner's practice. [70]
39.	vi. The bowl-food-eater's practice is undertaken with one of the following statements:
"I refuse a second vessel" or "I undertake the bowl-food-eater's practice."
When at the time of drinking rice gruel, the bowl-food eater gets curry that is
put in a dish; he can first either eat the curry or drink the rice gruel. If he puts it in
the rice gruel, the rice gruel becomes repulsive when a curry made with cured
fish, etc., is put into it. So it is allowable [to do this] only in order to use it without
making it repulsive. Consequently this is said with reference to such curry as that.
But what is unrepulsive, such as honey sugar,13 etc., should be put into it. And in
taking it he should take the right amount. It is allowable to take green vegetables
with the hand and eat them. But unless he does that they should be put into the
bowl. Because a second vessel has been refused it is not allowable [to use] anything
else, not even the leaf of a tree. These are its directions.
40.	This too has three grades. Herein, for one who is strict, except at the time of
eating sugarcane, it is not allowed [while eating] to throw rubbish away, and it is
not allowed while eating to break up rice-lumps, fish, meat and cakes. [The rubbish
should be thrown away and the rice-lumps, etc., broken up before starting to eat.]
The medium one is allowed to break them up with one hand while eating; and he
is called a "hand ascetic." The mild one is called a "bowl ascetic"; anything that
can be put into his bowl he is allowed, while eating, to break up, [that is, rice lumps,
etc.,] with his hand or [such things as palm sugar, ginger, etc.,] with his teeth.
The moment anyone of these three agrees to a second vessel his ascetic practice
is broken. This is the breach in this instance.
41.	The benefits are these. Craving for variety of tastes is eliminated; excessiveness
of wishes is abandoned; he sees the purpose and the [right] amount in nutriment;
he is not bothered with carrying saucers, etc., about; his life conforms to [the
principles of] fewness of wishes and so on.
42.	He baffles doubts that might arise
With extra dishes; downcast eyes|

13. Sakkara—"sugar": spelt sakkhara in PED.
`66
Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
The true devotedness imply14
Of one uprooting gluttony
Wearing content as if 'twere part
Of his own nature, glad at heart;
None but a bowl-food eater may
Consume his food in such a way
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the bowl-food-eater's practice. [71]
43. vii. The later-food-refuser's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse additional food" or "I undertake the later-food-refuser's
practice."
Now, when that later-food refuser has shown that he is satisfied, he should not
again have the food made allowable [bv having it put into his hands according to
the rule for bhikkhus] and eat it. These are the directions for it.
44.	This too has three grades. Herein, there is no showing that he has had enough
with respect to the first lump, but there is when he refuses more while that is being
swallowed. So when one who is strict has thus shown that he has had enough
[with respect to the second lump], he does not eat the second lump after swallowing
the first. The medium one eats also that food with respect to which he has shown
that he has had enough. But the mild one goes on eating until he gets up from his
seat.
The moment any one of these three has eaten what has been made allowable
[again] after he has shown that he has had enough, his ascetic practice is broken.
This is the breach in this instance.
45.	The benefits are these. One is far from committing an offence concerned with
extra food; there is no overloading of the stomach; there is no keeping food back;
there is no renewed search [for food]; he lives in conformity with [the principles
of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
46.	When a wise man refuses later food
He needs no extra search in weary mood,
Nor stores up food till later in the day
Nor overloads his stomach in this way.
So, would the adept from such faults abstain,
Let him assume this practice for his gain,
Praised by the Blessed One, which will augment
The special qualities such as content.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the later-food-refuser's practice.
47. viii. The forest-dweller's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse an abode in a village" or "I undertake the forest-dweller's
practice."
14. Snbbata—"truly devoted": fm. su + vata (having good vojws). See also §59.
`67
48.	Now, that forest dweller must leave an abode in a village in order to meet the
dawn in the forest. Herein, a village abode is the village itself with its precincts. A
"village" may consist of one cottage or several cottages, it may be enclosed by a
wall or not, have human inhabitants or not, and it can also be a caravan that is
inhabited for more than four months. [72] The "village precincts" c|over the range
of a stone thrown by a man of medium stature standing between the gate-posts of
a walled village, if there are two gate-posts, as at Anuradhapura (cf. Vin III 46). The
Vinaya experts say that this [stone's throw] is characterized as up to the place
where a thrown stone falls, as, for instance, when young men exercise their arms
and throw stones in order to show off their strength. But the Suttanta experts say
that it is up to where one thrown to scare crows normally falls. In the case of an
unwalled village, the house precinct is where the water falls when a woman standing
in the door of the outermost house of all throws water from a basin. Within a
stone's throw of the kind already described from that point is the village. Within a
second stone's throw is the village precinct.
49.	"Forest," according to the Vinaya method firstly, is described thus: "Except
the village and its precincts, all is forest" (Vin III 46). According to the Abhidhamma
method it is described thus: "Having gone out beyond the boundary post, all that
is forest" (Vibh 251; Patis I 176). But according to the Suttanta method its
characteristic is this: "A forest abode is five hundred bow-lengths distant" (Vin IV
183). That should be defined bv measuring it with a strung instructor's bow from
the gate-post of a walled village, or from the range of the first stone's throw from
an unwalled one, up to the monastery wall.
50.	But if the monastery is not walled, it is said in the Vinaya commentaries, it
should be measured by making the first dwelling of all the limit, or else the refectory
or regular meeting place or Bodhi Tree or shrine, even if that is far from a dwelling
[belonging to the monastery]. But in the Majjhima commentary it is said that,
omitting the precincts of the monastery and the village, the distance to be measured
is that between where the two stones fall. This i|s the measure here.
51.	Even if the village is close by and the sounds of men are audible to people in
the monastery still if it is not possible to go straight to it because of rocks, rivers,
etc., in between, the five hundred bow-lengths can be reckoned by that road even if
one has to go by boat, but anyone who blocks the path to the village here and there
for the purpose of [lengthening it so as to be able to say that he is] taking up the
practice is cheating the ascetic practice.
52.	If a forest-dwelling bliikkhu's preceptor or teacher is ill and does not get
what he needs in the forest, [73] he should take him to a village abode and attend
him there. But he should leave in time to meet the dawn in a place proper for the
practice. If the affliction increases towards the time of dawn, he must attend him
and not bother about the purity of his ascetic practice. These are the directions.
53.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict must always meet the dawn
in the forest. The medium one is allowed to live in a village for the four months of
the Rains. And the mild one, for the winter months too.
`68
Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
If in the period defined any one of these three goes from the forest and hears
the Dhamma in a village abode, his ascetic practice is not broken if he meets the
dawn there, nor is it broken if he meets it as he is on his way back after hearing [the
Dhamma]. But if, when the preacher has got up, he thinks "We shall go after lying
down awhile" and he meets the dawn while asleep or if of his own choice he meets
the dawn while in a village abode, then his ascetic practice is broken. This is the
breach in this instance.
54. The benefits are these. A forest-dwelling bhikkliu who has given attention to
the perception of forest (see MN121) can obtain hitherto unobtained concentration,
or preserve that already obtained. And the Master is pleased with him, according
as it is said: "So, Nagita, I am pleased with that bhikkhu's dwelling in the forest"
(A III 343). And when he lives in a remote abode his mind is not distracted by
unsuitable visible objects, and so on. He is free from anxiety; he abandons
attachment to life; he enjoys the taste of the bliss of seclusion, and the state of the
refuse-rag wearer, etc., becomes him.
55.	He lives secluded and apart,
Remote abodes delight his heart;
The Saviour of the world, besides,
He gladdens that in groves abides.
The hermit that in woods can dwell
Alone, may gain the bliss as well
Whose savour is beyond the price
Of royal bliss in paradise.
Wearing the robe of rags he may
Go forth into the forest fray;
Such is his mail, for weapons too
The other practices will do.
One so equipped can be assured
Of routing Mara and his horde.
So let the forest glades delight
A wise man for his dwelling's site.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the forest-dweller's practice. [74]
56.	ix. The tree-root-dzveller's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse a roof" or "I undertake the tree-root-dweller's practice."
The tree-root dweller should avoid such trees as a tree near a frontier, a shrine
tree, a gum tree, a fruit tree, a bats' tree, a hollow tree, or a tree standing in the
middle of a monastery. He can choose a tree standing on the outskirts of a monastery
These are the directions.
57.	This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict is not allowed to have a tree
that he has chosen tidied up He can move the fallen leaves with his foot while
dwelling there. The medium one is allowed to get it tidied up by those who happen
to come along. The mild one can take up residence there after summoning
`69
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
monastery attendants and novices and getting them to clear it up, level it, strew
sand and make a fence round with a gate fixed in it. On a special day a tree-root
dweller should sit in some concealed place elsewhere rather than there.
The moment any one of these three makes his abode under a roof, his ascetic
practice is broken. The reciters of the Anguttara say that it is broken as soon as he
knowingly meets the dawn under a roof. This is the breach in this instance.
58. The benefits are these. He practices in conformity with the dependence, because
of the words "The going forth by depending on the root of a tree as an abode" (Vin
158,96); it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus "Valueless, easy to
get, and blameless" (A II 26); perceptiojn of impermanence is aroused through
seeing the continual alteration of young leaves; avarice about abodes and love of
[building] work are absent; he dwells in the company of deities; he lives in
conformity with [the principles of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
59.	The Blessed One praised roots of trees
As one of the dependencies (Vin I 58);
Can he that loves secludedness
Find such another dwelling place?
Secluded at the roots of trees
And guarded well by deities
He lives in true devotedness
Nor covets any dwelling place. [75]
And when the tender leaves are seen
Bright red at first, then turning green,
And then to v|ellow as they fall,
He sheds belief once and for all
In permanence. Tree roots have been
Bequeathed bv him; secluded scene
No wise man will disdain at all
For contemplating [rise and fall].
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the tree-root-dweller's practice.
60. x. The open-air-dweller's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse a roof and a tree root" or "I undertake the open-air-dweller's
practice."
An open-air dweller is allowed to enter the Uposatha-house for the purpose of
hearing the Dhamma or for the purpose of the Uposatha. If it rains while he is
inside, he can go out when the rain is over instead of going out while it is still
raining. He is allowed to enter the eating hall or the fire room in order to do the
duties, or to go under a roof in order to ask elder bhikkhus in the eating hall about
a meal, or when teaching and taking lessons, or to take beds, chairs, etc., inside
that have been wrongly left outside. If he is going along a road with a requisite
belonging to a senior and it rains, he is allowed to go into a wayside rest house. If
he has nothing with him, he is not allowed to hurry in order to get to a rest house;
`70
Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
but he can go at his normal pace and enter it and stay there as long as it rains. These are
the directions for it. And the same rule applies to the tree-root dweller too.
61.	This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict is not allowed to live near
a tree or a rock or a house. He should make a robe-tent right out in the open and
live in that. The medium one is allowed to live near a tree or a rock or a house so
long as he is not covered bv them. The mild one is allowed these: a [rock] overhang
without a drip-ledge cut in it,15 a hut of branches, cloth stiffened with paste, and a
tent treated as a fixture, that has been left by field watchers, and so on.
The moment anv one of these three goes under a roof or to a tree root to dwell there,
[76] his ascetic practice is broken. The reciters] of the Anguttara sav that it is broken as
soon as he knowingly meets the dawn there. This is the breach in this case.
62.	The benefits are these: the impediment of dwellings is severed; stiffness and
torpor are expelled; his conduct deserves the praise "Like deer the bhikkhus live
unattached and homeless" (S1199); he is detached; he is [free to go in] any direction;
he lives in conformity with [the principles of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
63.	The open air provides a life
That aids the homeless bhikkhu's strife,
Easy to get, and leaves his mind
Alert as a deer, so he shall find
Stiffness and torpor brought to halt.
Under the star-bejewelled vault
The moon and sun furnish his light,
And concentration his delight.
The joy seclusion's savour gives
He shall discover soon who lives
In open air; and that is why
The wise prefer the open sky
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the open-air-dweller's practice.
64.	xi. The charnel-ground-dweller's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse what is not a charnel ground" or "I undertake the charnel-
ground-dweller's practice."
15. Reading acchinna-mariyadam with Vism-mht, which says: Without a drip-ledge
cut (acchinna-mariyadani)' means without a drip-ledge (mariyada) made above, which
might come under the heading of a drip-ledge (niariyada-sankhepena) made to prevent
rain water from coming in. But if the rain water comes under the overhang (pabblmra)
and is allowed to go in under it, then this comes under the heading of the open air
(abbhokasika-sankhepa)" (Vism-mht 84). This seems to refer to the widespread habit in
ancient Sri Lanka of cutting a drip-ledge on overhanging rocks used for bhikkhus'
dwellings so that the rain that falls on top of the rock drips down in front of the space
under the overhang instead of trickling down under the rock and wetting the back and
floor. Pabblmra in this context is "over hang" rather than "slope."
`71
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
Now, the charnel-ground dweller should not live in some place just because the
people who built the village have called it "the charnel ground" for it is not a
charnel ground unless a dead body has been burnt on it. But as soon as one has
been burnt on it, it becomes a charnel ground. And even if it has been neglected
for a dozen years, it is so still.
65. One who dwells there should not be the sort of person who gets walks,
pavilions, etc., built, has beds and chairs set out and drinking and washing water
kept ready and preaches Dhamma; for this ascetic practice is a momentous thing.
Whoever goes to live there should be diligent. And he should first inform the senior
elder of the Order or the king's local representative in order to prevent trouble.
When he walks up and down, he should do so looking at the pyre with half an eye.
[77] On his way to the charnel ground he should avoid the main roads and take a
by-path. He should define all the objects [there] while it is day, so that they will not
assume frightening shapes for him at night. Even if non-human beings wander
about screeching, he must not hit them with anything. It is not allowed to miss
going to the charnel ground even for a single day The reciters of the Anguttara say
that after spending the middle watch in the charnel ground he is allowed to leave
in the last watch. He should not take such foods as sesame flour, pease pudding,
fish, meat, milk, oil, sugar, etc., which are liked by non-human beings. He should
not enter the homes of [families.16 These are the directions for it.
66.	This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict should live where there are
always burnings and corpses and mourning. The medium one is allowed to live
where there is one of these three. The mild one is allowed to live in a place that
possesses the bare characteristics of a charnel ground already stated.
When any one of these three makes his abode in some place not a charnel ground,
his ascetic practice is broken. It is on the day on which he does not go to the charnel
ground, the Anguttara reciters say. This is the breach in this case.
67.	The benefits are these. He acquires mindfulness of death; he lives diligently;
the sign of foulness is available (see Ch. VI); greed for sense desires is removed; he
constantly sees the body's true nature; he has a great sense of urgency; he abandons
vanity of health, etc.; he vanquishes fear and dread (MN 4); non-human beings
respect and honour him; he lives in conformity with [the principles of] fewness of
wishes, and so on.
68.	Even in sleep the dweller in a charnel ground shows naught
Of negligence, for death is ever present to his thought;
He may be sure there is no lust after sense pleasure preys
Upon his mind, with many corpses present to his gaze.
Rightly he strives because he gains a sense of urgency
While in his search for final peace he curbs all vanity
Let him that feels a leaning to Nibbana in his heart
Embrace this practice for it has rare virtues to impart.
16. "He should not go into families' houses because he smells of the dead and is
followed by pisaca goblins" (Vism-mht 84).

Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the charnel-ground dweller's practice. [78]
69.	xii. The any-bed-user's practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse greed for resting places" or "I undertake the any-bed-user's
practice."
The any-bed user should be content with whatever resting place he gets thus:
"This falls to your lot." He must not make anyone else shift [from his bed]. These
are the directions.
70.	This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict is not allowed to ask about
the resting place that has fallen to his lot: "Is it far?" or "Is it too near?" or "Is it
infested by non-human beings, snakes, and so on?" or "Is it hot?" or "Is it cold?".
The medium one is allowed to ask, but not to go and inspect it. The mild one is
allowed to inspect it and, if he does not like it, to choose another.
As soon as greed for resting places arises in any one of these three, his ascetic
practice is broken. This is the breach in this instance.
71.	The benefits are these. The advice "He should be content with what he gets"
(J-a 1476; Vin IV 259) is carried out; he regards the welfare of his fellows in the life
of purity; he gives up caring about inferiority and superiority; approval and
disapproval are abandoned; the door is closed against excessive wishes; he lives in
conformity with [the principles] of fewness of wishes, and so on.
72.	One vowed to any bed will be
Content with what he gets, and he
Can sleep in bliss without dismay
On nothing but a spread of hay.
He is not eager for the best,
No lowly couch does he detest,
He aids his young companions too
That to the monk's good life are new.
So for a wise man to delight
In any kind of bed is right;
T ---------- o ^
A Noble One this custom loves
As one the sages' Lord approves.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the any-bed-user's practice.
73.	xiii. The sitter's practice is undertaken with one of the following statements: "I
refuse lying down" or "I undertake the sitter's practice."
The sitter can get up in any one of three watches of the night and walk up and
down: for lying down is the only posture not allowed. These are the directions. [79]
74.	This has three grades too. Herein, one who is strict is not allowed a back-rest
or cloth band or binding-strap [to prevent falling while asleep].17 The medium one
17. Ayogapatta—"a binding-strap": this is projbablv the meaning. But cf. Vin II1 35
and Vin-a 891.
`73
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
is allowed any one of these three. The mild one is allowed a back-rest, a cloth band,
a binding-strap, a cushion, a "five-limb" and a "seven-limb." A "five-limb" is [a
chair] made with [four legs and] a support for the back. A "seven-limb" is one
made with [four legs,] a support for the back and an [arm] support on each side.
They made that, it seems, for the Elder Plthabhaya (Abhaya of the Chair). The
elder became a non-returner, and then attained Nibbana.
As soon as any one of these three lies down, his ascetic practice is broken. This
is the breach in this instance.
75. The benefits are these. The mental shackle described thus, "He dwells indulging
in the pleasure of lving prone, the pleasure of lolling, the pleasure of torpor" (M I
102), is severed; his state is suitable for devotion to any meditation subject; his
deportment inspires confidence; his state favours the application of energy; he
develops the right practice.
76.	The adept that can place crosswise
His feet to rest upon his thighs
And sit with back erect shall make
Foul Mara's evil heart to quake.
No more in supine joys to plump
And wallow in lethargic dump;
Who sits for rest and finds it good
Shines forth in the Ascetics' Wood.
The happiness and bliss it brings
Has naught] to do with worldly things;
So must the sitter's vow befit
The manners of a man of wit.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the sitter's practice.
77.	Now, there is the commentary according to the stanza:
(4)	As to the profitable triad,
(5)	"Ascetic" and so on distinguished,
(6) As to groups, and also (7) singly
The exposition should be known (see §3).
78. 4. Herein, as to the profitable triad: (Dhs, pi) all the ascetic practices, that is to
say those of trainers, ordinary men, and men whose cankers have been destroyed,
may be either profitable or [in the Araliant's case] indeterminate. [80] No ascetic
practice is unprofitable.
But if someone should sa|v: There is also an unprofitable ascetic practice because
of the words "One of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, becomes a forest dweller" (A III
219), etc., he should be told: We have not said that he does not live in the forest
with unprofitable consciousness. Whoever has his dwelling in the forest is a forest
dweller; and he may be one of evil wishes or of few wishes. But, as it was said
above (§11), thev "are the practices (anga) of a bhikkliu who is ascetic (dhuta) because
he has shaken off (dhuta) defilement by undertaking one or other of them. Or the
`74
Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
knowledge that has got the name "ascetic" (dhuta) because it shakes off (dhunana)
defilement is a practice (anga) belonging to these, thus they are "ascetic practices"
(dhutanga). Or alternatively, they are ascetic (dhuta) because they shake off
(niddhunana) opposition, and they are practices (anga) because they are a way
(patipatti)." Now, no one called "ascetic" on account of what is unprofitable could
have these as his practices; nor does what is unprofitable shake off anything so
that those things to which it belonged as a practice could be called "ascetic
practices." And what is unprofitable does not both shake off cupidity for robes,
etc., and become the practice of the way Consequently it was rightly said that no
ascetic practice is unprofitable.
79. And those who hold that an ascetic practice is outside the profitable triad18
have no ascetic practice as regards meaning. Owing to the shaking off of what is
non-existent could it be called an ascetic practice? Also there are the words
"Proceeded to undertake the ascetic qualities" (Vin III 15), and it follows19 that
those words are contradicted. So that should not be accepted.
This, in the first place, is the commentary on the profitable triad.
80.	5. As to "ascetic and so on distinguished," the following things should be
understood, that is to say, ascetic, a preacher of asceticism, ascetic states, ascetic
practices, and for whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable.
81.	Herein, ascetic means either a person whose defilements are shaken off, or a
state that entails shaking off defilements.
A preacher of asceticism: one is ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism, another is
not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism, another is neither ascetic nor a preacher of
asceticism, and another is both ascetic and a preacher of asceticism.
82.	Herein, one who has shaken off his defilements with an ascetic practice but
does not advise and instruct another in an ascetic practice, like the Elder Bakkula,
is "ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the
venerable Bakkula was ascetic but not a preacher of asceticism."
One who [81] has not shaken off his own defilements but only advises and
instructs another in an ascetic practice, like the Elder Upananda, is "not ascetic but
a preacher of asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the venerable Upananda
son of the Sakvans was not ascetic but a preacher of asceticism."
One who has failed in both, like Laludayin, is "neither ascetic nor a preacher of
asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the venerable Laludayin was neither
ascetic nor a preacher of asceticism."
18.	For the triads of the Abhidhamma Matika (Abhidhamma Schedule) see Ch. XIII,
n.20. "'Those who hold': a reference to the inhabitants of the Abhayagiri Monastery at
Anuradhapura. For they say that ascetic practice is a concept consisting in a name
(narna-pannatti). That being so, they could have no meaning of shaking off defilements,
or possibility of being undertaken, because in the ultimate sense they would be non-
existent [concepts having no existence]" (Vism-mht 87). Cf. IV29.
19.	Apajjati (and its noun apatti) is the normal word used for undesirable consequences
that follow on some unsound logical proposition. See XVL68f. This meaning is not in PED.
`75
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
One who has succeeded in both, like the General of the Dhamma, is "both ascetic
and a preacher of asceticism," according as it is said: "Now, the venerable Sariputta
was ascetic and a preacher of asceticism."
83.	Ascetic states: the five states that go with the volition of an ascetic practice, that
is to say, fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, seclusion, and that specific
quality20 are [called "ascetic states' because of the words "Depending on fewness of
wishes" (A III 219), and so on.
84.	Herein, fewness of wishes and contentment are non-greed. Effacement and
seclusion belong to the two states, non-greed and non-delusion. That specific quality
is knowledge. Herein, by means of non-greed a man shakes off greed for things
that are forbidden. By means of non-delusion he shakes off the delusion that hides
the dangers in those same things. And by means of non-greed he shakes off
indulgence in pleasure due to sense desires that occurs under the heading of using
what is allowed. And by means of non-delusion he shakes off indulgence in self-
mortification that occurs under the heading of excessive effacement in the ascetic
practices. That is why these states should be understood as "ascetic states."
85.	Ascetic practices: these should be understood as the thirteen, that is to say the
refuse-rag-wearer's practice ... the sitter's practice, which have already been
described as to meaning and as to characteristic, and so forth.
86.	For whom the cultivation of ascetic practices is suitable: [they are suitable] for one
of greedy temperament and for one of deluded temperament. Why? Because the
cultivation of ascetic practices is both a difficult progress21 and an abiding in
effacement; and greed subsides with the difficult progress, while delusion is got
rid of in those diligent by effacement. Or the cultivation of the forest-dweller's
practice and the tree-root-dweller's practice here are suitable for one of hating
temperament; for hate too subsides in one who dwells there without coming into
conflict.
This is the commentary "as to 'ascetic' and so on distinguished." [82]
87.	6. and 7. As to groups and also singly. Now, 6. as to groups: these ascetic practices
are in fact onlv eight. that is to say. three nrincinal and five individual practices.
Herein, the three, namely, the house-to-house-seeker's practice, the one-sessioner's
practice, and the open-air-dweller's practice, are principal practices. For one who
keeps the house-to-house-seeker's practice will keep the alms-food-eater's practice;
and the bowl-food-eater's practice and the later-food-refuser's practice will be well
kept by one who keeps the one-sessioner's practice. And what need has one who
keeps the open-air-dweller's practice to keep the tree-root-dweller's practice or
the any-bed-user's practice? So there are these three principal practices that,
20.	Idarnatthita—"that specific quality": "Owing to these profitable states it exists, (thus
it is 'specific by those'; imehi kusaladliammehi atthi - idam-atthi). The knowledge by means
of which one who has gone forth should be established in the refuse-rag-wearer's
practice, etc., and by means of which, on being so instructed one undertakes and persists
in the ascetic qualities—that knowledge is idarnatthita" (Vism-mht 88).
21.	See XXI. 117.
`76
Path of Purification
Part 1: Virtue (Sila)
together with the five individual practices, that is to say, the forest-dweller's practice,
the refuse-rag-wearer's practice, the triple-robe-wearer's practice, the sitter's
practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller's practice, come to eight onlv.
88. Again they come to four, that is to say, two connected with robes, five connected
with alms food, five connected with the resting place, and one connected with
energy. Herein, it is the sitter's practice that is connected with energy; the rest are
obvious.
Again they all amount to two only since twelve are dependent on requisites
and one on energy Also they are two according to what is and what is not to be
cultivated. For when one cultivating an ascetic practice finds that his meditation
subject improves, he should cultivate it; but when he is cultivating one and finds
that his meditation subject deteriorates, he should not cultivate it. But when he
finds that, whether he cultivates one or not, his meditation subject only improves
and does not deteriorate, he should cultivate them out of compassion for later
generations. And when he finds that, whether he cultivates them or not, his
meditation subject does not improve, he should still cultivate them for the sake of
acquiring the habit for the future. So they are of two kinds as what is and what is
not to be cultivated.
89.	And all are of one kind as volition. For there is only one ascetic practice,
namely, that consisting in the volition of undertaking. Also it is said in the
Commentary: "It is the volition that is the ascetic practice, they say."
90.	7. Singly: with thirteen for bhikkhus, eight for bhikkhunis, twelve for novices,
seven for female probationers and female novices, and two for male and female lav
followers, there are thus forty-two.
91.	If there is a charnel ground in the open that complies with the forest-dweller's
practice, one bhikklui is able to put all the ascetic practices into effect simultaneously
But the two, namely, the forest-dweller's practice and the later-food-refuser's
practice, are forbidden to bhikkhunis by training precept. [83] And it is hard for
them to observe the three, namely the open-air-dweller's practice, the tree-root-
dweller's practice, and the charnel-ground-dweller's practice, because a bhikkhuni
is not allowed to live without a companion, and it is hard to find a female companion
with like desire for such a place, and even if available, she would not escape having
to live in company. This being so, the purpose of cultivating the ascetic practice
would scarcely be served. It is because they are reduced by five owing to this
inability to make use of certain of them that they are to be understood as eight
only for bhikkhunis.
92. Except for the triple-robe-wearer's practice all the other twelve as stated should
be understood to be for novices, and all the other seven for female probationers
and female novices.
The two, namely the one-sessioner's practice and the bowl-food-eater's practice,
are proper for male and female lay followers to employ. In this way there are two
ascetic practices.
This is the commentary "as to groups and also singly."
`77
Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
93. And this is the end of the treatise on the ascetic practices to be undertaken for
the purpose of perfecting those special qualities of fewness of wishes, contentment,
etc., by means of which there comes about the cleansing of virtue as described in
the Path of Purification, which is shown under the three headings of virtue,
concentration, and understanding, contained in the stanza, "When a wise man,
established well in virtue" (1.1).
The second chapter called "The Description of the Ascetic
Practices" in the Path of Purification composed for the
purpose of gladdening good people.

Part II
Concentration (Samadhi)

`81
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
(Kanunattharia-galiana-niddesa)
1. [84] Now, concentration is described under the heading of "consciousness" in
the phrase "develops consciousness and understanding" (1.1). It should be
developed by one who has taken his stand on virtue that has been purified by
means of the special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., and perfected by observance
of the ascetic practices. But that concentration has been shown only very briefly
and so it is not even easy to understand, much less to develop. There is therefore
the following set of questions, the purpose of which is to show the method of its
development in detail:
(i)	What is concentration?
(ii)	In what sense is it concentration?
(iii)	What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate
cause?
(iv)	How many kinds of concentration are there?
(v)	What is its defilement?
(vi)	What is its cleansing?
(vii)	How should it be developed?
(viii)	What are the benefits of the development of concentration?1
2. Here are the answers:
(i) What is concentration? Concentration is of many sorts and has various
aspects. An answer that attempted to cover it all would accomplish neither its
intention nor its purpose and would, besides, lead to distraction; so we shall confine
ourselves to the kind intended here, calling concentration profitable unification of
mind.2
1.	The answer to question (vii) stretches from 111.27 to XI. 119. That to question (viii)
from XI. 120 up to the end of Ch. XIII.
2.	"Cittass' ekaggata" is rendered here as "unification of mind" in the sense of
agreement or harmony (cf. samagga) of consciousness and its concomitants in focusing
on a single object (see A I 70). It is sometimes rendered "one-pointedness" in that
sense, or in the sense of the focusing of a searchlight. It may be concluded that this
term is simply a synonym for sarnadhi and nothing more, firstly from its use in the
suttas, and secondly from the fact that it is given no separate definition in the description
of the formations aggregate in Ch. XIV Cf. gloss at M-a 1124.
`82
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
3.	(ii) In what sense is it concentration? It is concentration (samadhi) in the sense
of concentrating (samadhana). What is this concentrating? It is the centring (adhana)
of consciousness and consciousness-concomitants evenly (samam) and rightly
(samrna) on a single object; placing, is what is meant. [85] So it is the state in virtue
of which consciousness and its concomitants remain evenly and rightly on a single
object, undistracted and unscattered, that should be understood as concentrating.
4.	(iii) What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?
Concentration has non-distraction as its characteristic.3 Its function is to eliminate
distraction. It is manifested as non-wavering. Because of the words, "Being blissful,
his mind becomes concentrated" (D I 73), its proximate cause is bliss.
5.	(iv) HOW MANY KINDS OF CONCENTRATION ARE THERE?
(1) First of all it is of one kind with the characteristic of non-distraction. (2)
Then it is of two kinds as access and absorption;4 (3) likewise as mundane and
supramundane,5 (4) as with happiness and without happiness, and (5) as
accompanied by bliss and accompanied by equanimity.6 It is of three kinds (6) as
inferior, medium and superior; likewise (7) as with applied thought and sustained
thought, etc., (8) as accompanied by happiness, etc., and (9) as limited, exalted,
and measureless. It is of four kinds (10) as of difficult progress and sluggish
3.	"The characteristic of non-distraction is the individual essence peculiar to
concentration. Hence no analysis of it is possible, which is why he said: 'It is of one kind
with the characteristic of non-distraction'" (Vism-mht 91).
4.	"Applied thought that occurs as though absorbing (appento) associated states in
the object is absorption (appana). Accordingly it is described as 'absorption, absorbing
(appana vyappana)' (M III 73). Now since that is the most important, the usage of the
Commentaries is to call all exalted and unsurpassed jhana states 'absorption' [as well
as the applied thought itself], and likewise to apply the term of commo|n usage 'access'
to the limited [i.e. sense-sphere] jhana that heralds the arising of the former, just as the
term 'village access,' etc. is applied to the neighbourhood of a village" (Vism-mht 91).
5.	"The round (vatta, see XVII.298) [including fine-material and immaterial heavens]
is called the world (Ioka) because of its crumbling (lujjana) and disintegrating (palujjana).
'Mundane' (lokiya) means connected with the world because of being included in it or
found there. 'Supramundane' (lokuttara) means beyond the world, excepted from it,
because of not being included in it [through being associated with Nibbana]" (Vism-
mht 91). See also "nine supranumdane states. (VII.68, 74f.)"
6. In loose usage pJti (happiness) and suklia (pleasure or bliss) are almost synonyms.
They become differentiated in the jhana formulas (see IV100), and then technically plti,
as the active thrill of rapture, is classed under the formations aggregate and suklia under
the feeling aggregate. The valuable word "happiness" was chosen for plti rather than
the possible alternatives of "joy" (needed for somanassa), "interest" (which is too flat),
"rapture" (which is overcharged), or "zest." For suklia, while "pleasure" seemed to fit
admirably where ordinary pleasant feeling is intended, another, less crass, word seemed
necessary for the refined pleasant feeling of jhana and the "bliss" of Nibbana (which is
not feeling aggregate—see M 1400). "Ease" is sometimes used.
"Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is intended here by 'equanimity' (upekkha, lit,
onlooking); for it 'looks on' (upekkhati) at the occurrence of [bodiljy] pleasure and pain
by maintaining the neutral (central) mode" (Vism-mht 92).
`83
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
direct-knowledge, etc.; likewise |(11) as limited with limited object, etc., (12)
according to the factors of the four jlianas, (13) as partaking of diminution, etc.,
(14) as of the sense sphere, etc., and (15) as predominance, and so on. (16) It is of
five kinds according to the factors of the five jlianas reckoned by the fivefold method.
6. 1. Herein, the section dealing with that of one kind is evident in meaning.
2. In the section dealing with that of two kinds, access concentration is the
unification of mind obtained by the following, that is to say, the six recollections,
mindfulness of death, the recollection of peace, the perception of repulsiveness in
nutriment, and the defining of the four elements, and it is the unification that
precedes absorption concentration. Absorption concentration is the unification that
follows immediately upon the preliminary-work (IV74) because of the words, "The
first-jhana preliminary-work is a condition, as proximity condition, for the first
jhana" (Patth II 350 (Se). So it is of two kinds as access and absorption.
7.	3. In the second dyad mundane concentration is profitable unification of mind
in the three planes. Supramundane concentration is the unification associated with
the noble paths. So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.
8.	4. In the third dyad concentration with happiness is the unification of mind in
two jlianas in the fourfold reckoning and in three jlianas in the fivefold reckoning.
[86] Concentration without happiness is the unification in the remaining two jlianas.
But access concentration may be with happiness or without happiness. So it is of
two kinds as with happiness and without happiness.
9.	5. In the fourth dyad concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in
three jlianas in the fourfold and four in the fivefold reckoning. That accompanied by
equanimity is that in the remaining jhana. Access concentration may be accompanied
by bliss or accompanied by equanimity. So it is of two kinds as accompanied by
bliss and accompanied by equanimity.
10.	6. In the first of the triads what has only just been acquired is inferior. What is
not very well developed is medium. What is well developed and has reached mastery
is superior. So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.
11.	7. In the second triad that with applied thought and sustained thought is the
concentration of the first jhana together with access concentration. That without
applied thought, with sustained thought only, is the concentration of the second jhana
in the fivefold reckoning. For when a man sees danger onlv in applied thought
and not in sustained thought, he aspires only to abandon applied thought when
he passes beyond the first jhana, and so he obtains concentration without applied
thought and with sustained thought only. This is said with reference to him.
Concentration without applied thought and sustained thought is the unification in the
three jhanas beginning with the second in the fourfold reckoning and with the
third in the fivefold reckoning (see D III 219). So it is of three kinds as with applied
thought and sustained thought, and so on.
12. 8. In the third triad concentration accompanied by happiness is the unification
in the two first jhanas in the fourfold reckoning and in the three first jhanas in the
fivefold reckoning. Concentration accompanied by bliss is the unification in those
same jhanas and in the third and the fourth respectively in the two reckonings.
`84
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
That accompanied by equanimity is that in the remaining jhana. Access concentration
may be accompanied by bliss and happiness or accompanied by equanimity. So it
is of three kinds as accompanied by happiness, and so on.
13.	9. In the fourth triad limited concentration is unification on the plane of access.
Exalted concentration is unification in profitable [consciousness, etc.,] of the fine-
material sphere and immaterial sphere. Measureless concentration is unification
associated with the noble paths. So it is of three kinds as limited, exalted, and
measureless.
14.	10. In the first of the tetrads there is concentration of diffiarit progress and
sluggish direct-knozvledge. There is that of difficult progress and swift direct-
knowledge. There is that of easy progress and sluggish direct-knowledge. And
there is that of easy progress and swift direct-knowledge.
15.	Herein, the development of concentration that occurs from the time of the
first conscious reaction up to the arising of the access of a given jhana is called
progress. And the understanding that occurs from the time of access until absorption
is called direct-knowledge. That progress is difficult for some, being troublesome
owing to the tenacious resistance of the inimical states beginning with the
hindrances. The meaning is that it is cultivated without ease. [87] It is easy for
others because of the absence of those difficulties. Also the direct-knowledge is
sluggish in some and occurs slowly not quickly In others it is swift and occurs
rapidly not slowly
16. Herein, we shall comment below upon the suitable and unsuitable (IV35f.), the
preparatory tasks consisting in the severing of impediments (IV20), etc., and skill in
absorption (IV42). When a man cultivates what is unsuitable, his progress is difficult
and his direct-knowledge sluggish. When he cultivates what is suitable, his progress is
easy and his direct-knowledge swift. But if he cultivates the unsuitable in the earlier
stage and the suitable in the later stage, or if he cultivates the suitable in the earlier
stage and the unsuitable in the later stage, then it should be understood as mixed in
his case. Likewise if he devotes himself to development without carrying out the
preparatory tasks of severing impediments, etc., his progress is difficult. It is easy in
the opposite case. And if he is not accomplished in skill in absorption, his direct-
knowledge is sluggish. It is swift if he is so accomplished.
17.	Besides, they should be understood as classed according to craving and
ignorance, and according to whether one has had practice in serenity and insight.7
For if a man is overwhelmed by craving, his progress is difficult. If not, it is easy
And if he is overwhelmed by ignorance, his direct-knowledge is sluggish. If not, it
is swift. And if he has had no practice in serenity his progress is difficult. If he has,
it is easy And if he has had no practice in insight, his direct-knowledge is sluggish.
If he has, it is swift.
18.	Also they should be understood as classed according to defilements and
faculties. For if a man's defilements are sharp and his faculties dull, then his progress
7. Samatha—"serenity" is a synonym for absorption concentration, and "insight"
(vipassana) a synonym for understanding. Samatha is sometimes rendered by
"tranquillity" (reserved here for passaddhi) or "calm" or "quiet."

Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
is difficult and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are keen, his
direct-knowledge is swift. And if his defilements are blunt and his faculties dull,
then his progress is easy and his direct-knowledge sluggish; but if his faculties are
keen, his direct-knowledge is swift.
19.	So as regards this progress and this direct-knowledge, when a person reaches
concentration with difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, his
concentration is called concentration of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge;
similarly in the cases of the remaining three.
So it is of four kinds as of difficult progress and sluggish direct-knowledge, and
so on.
20.	11. In the second tetrad there is limited concentration with a limited object,
there is limited concentration with a measureless object, there is measureless
concentration with a limited object, and there is measureless concentration with a
measureless object. Herein, concentration that is unfamiliar and incapable of being
a condition for a higher jhana [88] is limited. When it occurs with an unextended
object (IV126), it is with a limited object. When it is familiar, well developed, and
capable of being a condition for a higher jhana, it is measureless. And when it occurs
with an extended object, it is with a measureless object. The mixed method can be
understood as the mixture of the characteristics already stated. So it is of four
kinds as limited with limited object, and so on.
21.	12. In the third tetrad the first jhana has five factors, that is to say applied
thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and concentration, following
suppression of the hindrances. The second has the three factors remaining after
the elimination of applied and sustained thought. The third has two factors with
the fading away of happiness. The fourth, where bliss is abandoned, has two factors
with concentration and the equanimous feeling that accompanies it. Thus there
are four kinds of concentration according to the factors of these four jhanas. So it is
of four kinds according to the factors of the four jhanas.
22.	13. In the fourth tetrad there is concentration partaking of diminution, there
is concentration partaking of stagnation, there is concentration partaking of
distinction, and there is concentration partaking of penetration. Herein, it should
be understood that the state of partaking of diminution is accessibility to opposition,
the state of partaking of stagnation (thiti) is stationariness (santhana) of the
mindfulness that is in conformity with that [concentration], the state of partaking of
distinction is the attaining of higher distinction, and the state of partaking of
penetration is accessibility to perception and attention accompanied by dispassion,
according as it is said: "When a man has attained the first jhana and he is accessible
to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire, then his understanding
partakes of diminution. When his mindfulness that is in conformity with that
stagnates, then his understanding partakes of stagnation. When he is accessible to
perception and attention unaccompanied by applied thought, then his
understanding partakes of distinction. When he is accessible to perception and
attention accompanied by dispassion and directed to fading away, then his
understanding partakes of penetration" (Vibh 330). The kinds of concentration
`86
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
associated with that [fourfold] understanding are also four in number. So it is of
four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.
23.	14. In the fifth tetrad there are the following four kinds of concentration, that
is to say sense-sphere concentration, fine-material-sphere concentration, immaterial-
sphere concentration, and unincluded [that is, path] concentration. Herein, sense-
sphere concentration is all kinds of access unification. Likewise the other three are
respectively profitable unification of mind associated with fine-material,
[immaterial, and path, jhana]. So it is of four kinds as of the sense-sphere, and so
24.	15. In the sixth tetrad: "If a bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains unification
of mind, by making zeal (desire) predominant, [89] this is called concentration
due to zeal. If ... by making energy predominant... If ... by making [natural purity
of] consciousness predominant... If ... by making inquiry predominant, this is
J	I	7	O	I 7 I
called concentration due to inquiry" (Vibh 216-19). So it is of four kinds as
predominance.
25.	16. In the pentad there are five jhanas by dividing in two what is called the
second jhana in the fourfold reckoning (see §21), taking the second jhana to be due
to the surmounting of only applied thought and the third jhana to be due to the
surmounting of both applied and sustained thought. There are five kinds of
concentration according to the factors of these five jhanas. So its fivefoldness should
be understood according to the five sets of jhana factors.
26.	(v) What is its defilement? (vi) What is its cleansing? Here the answer is given
in the Vibhariga: "Defilement is the state partaking of diminution, cleansing is the
state partaking of distinction" (Vibh 343). Herein, the state partaking of diminution
should be understood in this way: "When a man has attained the first jhana and he
is accessible to perception and attention accompanied by sense desire, then his
understanding partakes of diminution" (Vibh 330). And the state partaking of
distinction should be understood in this way: "When he is accessible to perception
and attention unaccompanied by applied thought, then his understanding partakes
of distinction" (Vibh 330).
27.	(vii) How should it he developed?
[A. Development in Brief]
The method of developing the kind of concentration associated with the noble
paths mentioned (§7) under that "of two kinds as mundane and supramundane,"
etc., is included in the method of developing understanding; (Ch. XXII) for in
developing [path] understanding that is developed too. So we shall say nothing
separately [here] about how that is to be developed.
28.	But mundane concentration should be developed by one who has taken his
stand on virtue that is quite purified in the way already stated. He should sever
any of the ten impediments that he may have. He should then approach the good
friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among
the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament. After that he
should avoid a monastery unfavourable to the development of concentijation and
`87
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
go to live in one that is favourable. Then he should sever the lesser impediments
and not overlook any of the directions for development. This is in brief.
[B. Development in Detail]
29. The detail is this:
[The Ten Impediments]
Firstly it was said above, he should sever any of the ten impediments that he may
have. [90] Now, the "ten impediments" are:
A dwelling, family and gain,
A class, and building too as fifth,
And travel, kin, affliction, books,
And supernormal powers: ten.
Herein, the dwelling itself is the "impediment due to the dwelling." So too with
the family and so on.
30.	1. Herein, a single inner room or a single hut or a whole monastery for the
Community is called a dwelling. This is not an impediment for everyone. It is an
impediment only for anyone whose mind is exercised about the building, etc., that
goes on there, or who has many belongings stored there, or whose mind is caught
up by some business connected with it. For any other it is not an impediment.
31.	Here is a relevant story. Two clansmen left Anuradhapura, it seems, and
eventually went forth at the Thuparama.8 One of them made himself familiar with
the Two Codes,9 and when he had acquired five years' seniority he took part in the
Pavarana10 and then left for the place called Pacmakhandaraji.11 The other stayed
on where he was. Now, when the one who had gone to Pacmakhandaraji had lived
there a long time and had become an elder,12 he thought, "This place is good for
retreat; suppose I told my friend about it?" So he set out, and in due course he
entered the Thuparama. As he entered, the elder of the same seniority saw him,
went to meet him, took his bowl and robe and did the duties.

8.	One of the principal monasteries in Anuradhapura.
9.	Dve matika—the "two codes": see Ch. I, n. 11. But Vism-mht says here: '"Observers
of the codes' are observers of the codes (summaries) of the Dhamma and
Vinaya" (Vism-mht 117).
10.	Pavarana: ceremony held at the end of the rains, during three months of which
season bhikkhus have to undertake to live in one place in order to avoid travel while
crops are growing. It consists in a meeting of the bhikkhus who have spent the rains
together, at which each member present invites (pavareti) the Community to point out
his faults (breaches of Vinaya rules) committed during the preceding three months
(Vin 1155).
11.	"Pacinakhandaraja ti purattliimadisaya pabbatakhandanani antare variarajltthananr
(Vism-mht 97).
12.	For the first five years after the admission (upasampada) a bhikkhu is called a "new
(nava) bhikkhu"; from five to ten years he is called a "middle (majjhima) bhikkhu";
with ten or more years' seniority he is called an "elder (them) bhikkhu."

32.	The visiting elder went into his lodging. He thought, "Now my friend will be
sending me ghee or molasses or a drink; for he has lived long in this city." He got
nothing that night, and in the morning he thought, "Now he will be sending me
rice gruel and solid food sent by his supporters." When he saw none, he thought,
"There is no one to bring it. No doubt thev will give it when we go into the town."
Earlv in the morning they went into the town together. When they had wandered
through one street and had got onlv a ladleful of gruel, they sat down in a sitting
hall to drink it.13
33.	Then the visitor thought, "Perhaps there is no individual giving of gruel. But
as soon as it is the time for the meal people will give special food." But when it was
time for the meal, they ate what they had got by wandering for alms. Then the
visitor said, "Venerable sir, how is this? Do you live in this way all the time?"—
"Yes, friend."—"Venerable sir, Pacmakhandaraji is comfortable; let us go there."
Now, as the elder came out from the city [91] by the southern gate he took the
Kumbhakaragama road [which leads to Pacmakhandaraji]. The visitor asked, "But,
venerable sir, why do you take this road?"—"Did you not recommend
Pacmakhandaraji, friend?"—"But how is this, venerable sir, have you no extra
belongings in the place you have lived in for so long?"—"That is so, friend. The
bed and chair belong to the Community and they are put away [as usual]. There is
nothing else."—"But, venerable sir, I have left my staff and my oil tube and my
sandal bag there."—"Have you already collected so much, friend, living there for
just one day?"—"Yes, venerable sir."
34.	He was glad in his heart, and he paid homage to the elder: "For those like
you, venerable sir, everywhere is a forest dwelling. The Thuparama is a place where
the relics of four Buddhas are deposited; there is suitable hearing of the Dhamma
in the Brazen Palace; there is the Great Shrine to be seen; and one can visit elders.
It is like the time of the Buddha. It is here that you should live." On the following
day he took his bowl and [outer] robe and went away by himself. It is no impediment
for one like that.
35.	2 Family means a family consisting of relatives or of supporters. For even a
family consisting of supporters is an impediment for someone who lives in close
association with it in the wav beginning, "He is pleased when they are pleased" (S
III 11), and who does not even go to a neighbouring monastery to hear the Dhamma
without members of the family
36.	But even mother and father are not an impediment for another, as in the case
of the young bhikkhu, the nephew of the elder who lived at the Korandaka
Monastery. He went to Rohana for instruction, it seems. The elder's sister, who was
a lay devotee, was always asking the elder how her son was getting on. One day
the elder set out for Rohana to fetch him back.
37.	The young bhikkhu too thought, "I have lived here for a long time. Now I
might go and visit my preceptor and find out how the lay devotee is," and he left
13. The last sentence here might refer to a free mass distribution of gruel (yagu), which
appears to have been more or less constantly maintained at Anuradhapura.

Rohana. The two met on the banks of the [Mahaveli] River. He did the duties to the
elder at the foot of a tree. When asked, "Where are you going?" he told him his
purpose. The elder said: "You have done well. The lay devotee is always asking
after you. That was why I came. You may go, but I shall stay here for the Rains,"
and he dismissed him. [92] He arrived at the monastery on the actual day for taking
up residence for the Rains. The lodging allotted to him happened to be the one for
which his father had undertaken responsibility.
38. His father came on the following day and asked, "To whom was our lodging
allotted, venerable sirs?" When he heard that it had fallen to a young visitor, he
went to him. After paying homage to him, he said, "Venerable sir, there is an
obligation for him who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging."—
"What is it, lay follower?"—"It is to take alms food only in our house for the three
months, and to let us know the time of departure after the Pavarana ceremony."
He consented in silence. The lay devotee went home and told his wife. "There is a
visiting lord who has taken up residence for the Rains in our lodging. He must be
carefully looked after," and she agreed. She prepared good food of various kinds
for him.14 Though the youth went to his relatives' home at the time of the meal, no
one recognized him.
39.	When he had eaten alms food there during the three months and had
completed the residence for the Rains, he announced his departure. Then his
relatives said, "Let it be tomorrow, venerable sir," and on the following day when
they had fed him in their house and filled his oil tube and given him a lump of
sugar and a ninq-cubit length of cloth, they said, "Now you are leaving, venerable
sir." He gave his blessing and set out for Rohana.
40.	His preceptor had completed the Pavarana ceremony and was on his way
back. They met at the same place as before. He did the duties to the elder at the
foot of a tree. The elder asked him, "How was it, my dear, did you see the good
woman lay devotee?" He replied, "Yes, venerable sir," and he told him all that had
happened. He then anointed the elder's feet with the oil, made him a drink with
the sugar, and presented him with the length of cloth. He then, after paying homage
to the elder, told him, "Venerable sir, only Rohana suits me," and he departed. The
elder too arrived back at his monastery, and next day he went into the village of
Korandaka.
41. The lay devotee, his sister, had always kept looking down the road, thinking,
"My brother is now coming with my son." When she saw him coming alone, she
thought, "My son must be dead; that is why the elder is coming alone," and she
fell at the elder's feet, lamenting and weeping. Suspecting that it must have been
out of fewness of wishes that the youth had gone away without announcing himself,
[93] the elder comforted her and told her all that had happened, and he took the
length of cloth out of his bag and showed it to her.
14. It is usual to render the set phrase pan!tain khadannjam phojaniyani by some such
phrase as "sumptuous food both hard and soft," which is literal but unfamiliar-
sounding.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
42.	She was appeased. She prostrated herself in the direction taken by her son,
and she said: "Surely the Blessed One taught the way of the Rathavinlta, the way
of the Nalaka, the way of the Tuva taka, and the way of the great Noble Ones'
heritages15 showing contentment with the four requisites and delight in
development, making a bhikkhu such as my son a body-witness. So, although for
three months he ate in the house of the mother who bore him, yet he never said T
am your son, you are my mother!' Oh, admirable man!" Even mother and father
are no impediment for one such as him, so how much less any other family that
supports him.
43.	3. Gain is the four requisites. How are they an impediment? Wherever a
meritorious bhikkhu goes, people give him a large supply of requisites. With giving
blessings to them and teaching them the Dhamma he gets no chance to do the
ascetic's duties. From sunrise till the first watch of the night he never breaks his
association with people. Again, even at dawn, alms-food eaters fond of opulence
come and say, "Venerable sir, such and such a man lay follower, woman lay follower,
friend, friend's daughter, wants to see you," and being ready to go, he replies,
"Take the bowl and robe, friend." So he is always on the alert. Thus these requisites
are an impediment for him. He should leave his group and wander by himself
where he is not known. This is the way his impediment is severed.
44.	4 Class is a class (group) of students of suttas or students of Abhidhamma. If
with the group's instruction and questioning he gets no opportunity for the ascetic's
duties, then that group is an impediment for him. He should sever that impediment
in this way: if those bhikkhus have already acquired the main part and little still
remains, he should finish that off and then go to the forest. If they have only acquired
little and much still remains, [94] he should, without travelling more than a league,
approach another instructor of a class within the radius of a league and say "Help
those venerable ones with instruction, etc." If he does not find anyone in this way,
he should take leave of the class, saying. "I have a task to see to, friends; go where
it suits you," and he should do his own work.
45.	5. Building (kamma) is new building work (nava-kamma). Since one engaged
in this must know about what [material] has and has not been got by carpenters,
etc., and must see about what has and has not been done, it is always an impediment.
It should be severed in this way If little remains it should be completed. If much
remains, it should be handed over to the Community or to bhikkhus who are
entrusted with the Community's affairs, if it is a new building for the Community;
or if it is for himself, it should be handed over to those whom he entrusts with his
own affairs, but if these are not available, he should relinquish it to the Community
and depart.
15. "The way of the Rathavinita (Rathavimta-patipada)": this is a reference to certain
suttas that were adopted by bhikkhus as a "wav" (patipada) or guid|e to practice. The
suttas mentioned here are Rathavinita (M1145), Nalaka (Sn, p. 131), Tuvataka (Sn 179),
Noble One's Heritages (ariyavarnsa—A II 27). Others are mentioned at M-a I 92; III 6;
S-a III 291. The Ariyavarnsa Sutta itself has a long commentary on practice, and it is
mentioned in the Commentaries as a popular subject for preaching (see e.g. commentary
to AN III 42).
`91
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
46.	6. Travel is going on a journey. If someone is expected to give the going forth
somewhere else, or if some requisite is obtainable there and he cannot rest content
without getting it [that will be an impediment; for] even if he goes into the forest
to do the ascetic's duties, he will find it hard to get rid of thoughts about the journey.
So one in this position should apply himself to the ascetic's duties after he has
done the journey and transacted the business.
47.	7 Kin in the case of the monastery means teacher, preceptor, co-resident, pupil,
those with the same preceptor as oneself, and those with the same teacher as oneself;
and in the case of the house it means mother, father, brother, and so on. When they
are sick they are an impediment for him. Therefore that impediment should be
severed by curing them with nursing.
48.	Herein, when the preceptor is sick he must be cared for as long as life lasts if
the sickness does not soon depart. Likewise the teacher at the going forth, the
I	o o	7
teacher at the admission, the co-resident, the pupils to whom one has given the
admission and the going forth, and those who have the same preceptor. But the
teacher from whom one takes the dependence, the teacher who gives one
instruction, the pupil to whom one has given the dependence, the pupil to whom
one is giving instruction, and those who have that same teacher as oneself, should
be looked after as long as the dependence or the instruction has not been terminated.
If one is able to do so, one should look after them even beyond that [period].
49. Mother and father should be treated like the preceptor; if they live within the
kingdom and look to their son for help, it should be given. [95] Als|o if they have no
medicine, he should give them his own. If he has none, he should go in search of it
as alms and give that. But in the case of brothers or sisters, one should onlv give
them what is theirs. If they have none, then one should give one's own temporarily
and later get it back, but one should not complain if one does not get it back. It is
not allowed either to make medicine for or to give it to a sister's husband who is
not related by blood; but one can give it to one's sister saying, "Give it to your
husband." The same applies to one's brother's wife. But it is allowed to make it for
their children since they are blood relatives.
50.	8. Affliction is any kind of illness. It is an impediment when it is actually
afflicting; therefore it should be severed by treatment with medicine. But if it is not
cured after taking medicine for a few days, then the ascetic's duties should be
done after apostrophizing one's person in this way: "I am not your slave, or your
hireling. I have come to suffering through maintaining you through the
beginningless round of rebirths."
51.	9. Books means responsibility for the scriptures. That is an impediment only
for one who is constantly busy with recitations, etc., but not for others. Here are
relevant stories. The Elder Revata, it seems, the Majjhima reciter, went to the Elder
Revata, the dweller in Malaya (the Hill Country), and asked him for a meditation
subject. The elder asked him, "How are you in the scriptures, friend?"—"I am
studying the Majjhima [Nikaya], venerable sir."—"The Majjhima is a hard
responsibility friend. When a man is still learning the First Fifty by heart, he is
faced with the Middle Fifty; and when he is still learning that by heart, he is faced
`92
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
with the Last Fifty. How can you take up a meditation subject?"—"Venerable sir,
when I have taken a meditation subject from you, I shall not look at the scriptures
again." He took the meditation subject, and doing no recitation for nineteen years,
he reached Arahantship in the twentieth year. He told bhikkhus who came for
recitation: "I have not looked at the scriptures for twenty years, friends, [96] vet I
am familiar with them. You may begin." And from beginning to end he had no
hesitation even over a single syllable.
52.	The Elder Maha-Naga, too, who lived at Karulivagiri (Karaliyagiri) put aside
the scriptures for eighteen years, and then he recited the Dhatukatha to the
bhikkhus. When they checked this with the town-dwelling elders [of Anuradlia-
pura], not a single question was found out of its order.
53.	In the Great Monastery too the Elder Tipitaka-Cula-Abhaya had the golden
drum struck, saving: "I shall expound the three Pitakas in the circle of [experts in]
the Five Collections of discourses," and this was before he had learnt the
commentaries. The Community of Bhikkhus said, "'Which teachers' teaching is
it? Unless you give only the teaching of our own teachers we shall not let you
speak." Also his preceptor asked him when he went to wait on him, "Did you have
the drum beaten, friend?"—"Yes, venerable sir."—"For what reason?"—"I shall
expound the scriptures, venerable sir."—"Friend Abhaya, how do the teachers
explain this passage?"—"They explain it in this way, venerable sir." The elder
dissented, saying "Hum." Again three times, each time in a different way, he said,
"They explain it in this way, venerable sir." The elder always dissented, saying,
"Hum." Then he said, "Friend, your first explanation was the way of the teachers.
But it is because you have not actually learnt it from the teachers' lips that you are
unable to maintain that the teachers say suc|h and such. Go and learn it from our
own teachers."—"Where shall I go, venerable sir?"—"There is an elder named Maha
Dhammarakkhita living in the Tuladharapabbata Monastery in the Rohana country
beyond the [Mahaveli] River. He knows all the scriptures. Go to him." Saving,
"Good, venerable sir," he paid homage to the elder. He went with five hundred
bhikkhus to the Elder Maha-Dhammarakkhita, and when he had paid homage to
him, he sat down. The elder asked, "Why have vou come?"—"To hear the Dhamma,
venerable sir."—"Friend Abhaya, they ask me about the Dlgha and the Majjhima
from time to time, but I have not looked at the others for thirty years. Still vou may
repeat them in my presence by night, and I shall explain them to you by day." He
said, "Good, venerable sir," and he acted accordingly.
54.	The inhabitants of the village had a large pavilion built at the door of his
dwelling, and they came daily to hear the Dhamma. Explaining by day what had
been repeated by night, [97] the Elder [Dhammarakkhita] eventually completed
the instruction. Then he sat down on a mat on the ground before the Elder Abhaya
and said, "Friend, explain a meditation subject to me."—"What are you saying,
venerable sir, have I not heard it all from you? What can I explain to you that you
do not already know?" The senior elder [said, "This path is different for one who
has actually travelled by."
55.	The Elder Abhaya was then, it seems, a stream-enterer. When the Elder Abhaya
had given his teacher a meditation subject, he returned to Anuradhapura. Later,
`93
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
while he was expounding the Dhamma in the Brazen Palace, he heard that the
elder had attained Nibbana. On hearing this, he said, "Bring me [my] robe, friends."
Then he put on the robe and said, "The Araliant path befits our teacher, friends.
Our teacher was a true thoroughbred. He sat down on a mat before his own
Dhamma pupil and said, 'Explain a meditation subject to me.' The Arahant path
befits our teacher, friends."
For such as these, books are no impediment.
56. 10. Supernormal powers are the supernormal powers of |the ordinary man.
They are hard to maintain, like a prone infant or like young corn, and the
slightest thing breaks them. But they are an impediment for insight, not for
concentration, since they are obtainable through concentration. So the
supernormal powers are an impediment that should be severed by one who
seeks insight; the others are impediments to be severed by one who seeks
0--,
concentration.
This, in the first place, is the detailed explanation of the impediments.
57.	Approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject (§28): meditation subjects
are of two kinds, that is, generally useful meditation subjects and special meditation
subjects. Herein, loving-kindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus, etc., and
also mindfulness of death are what are called generally useful meditation subjects.
Some say perception of foulness, too.
58.	When a bhikkhu takes up a meditation subject, he should first develop
loving-kindness towards the Community of Bhikkhus within the boundary/6
limiting it at first [to "all bhikkhus in this monastery"], in this way: "May they
be happy and free from affliction." Then he should develop it towards all deities
within the boundary. Then towards all the principal people in the village that
is his alms resort; then to [all human beings there and to] all living beings
dependent on the human beings. With loving-kindness towards the Community
of Bhikkhus he produces kindliness in his co-residents; then they are easy for
him to live with. With loving-kindness towards the deities within the boundary
he is protected by kindly deities with lawful protection. [98] With loving-
kindness towards the principal people in the village that is his alms resort his
requisites are protected by well-disposed principal people with lawful
protection. With loving-kindness to all human beings there he goes about
without incurring their dislike since they trust him. With loving-kindness to
all living beings he can wander unhindered everywhere.
With mindfulness of death, thinking, "I have got to die," he gives up improper
search (see S II194; M-a 1115), and with a growing sense of urgency he comes to
live without attachment. When his mind is familiar with the perception of foulness,
then even divine objects do not tempt his mind to greed.
16. Sima—"boundary": looselv used in this sense, it corresponds vaguely to what is meant
by "parish." In the strict sense it is the actual area (usually a "chapter ho|use") agreed
according to the rules laid down in the Vinaya and marked by boundary stones, within
which die Community (sanglta) carries out its formal acts.
`94
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
59.	So these are called "generally useful" and they are "called meditation subjects"
since they are needed17 generally and desirable owing to their great helpfulness
and since they are subjects for the meditation work intended.
60.	What is called a "special meditation subject" is that one from among the forty
meditation subjects that is suitable to a man's own temperament. It is "special"
(parihariya) because he must carry it (pariharitabbatta) constantly about with him,
and because it is the proximate cause for each higher stage of development.
So it is the one who gives this twofold meditation subject that is called the giver
of a meditation subject.
61.	The good friend is one who possesses such special qualities as these:
He is revered and dearly loved,
And one who speaks and suffers speech;
The speech he utters is profound,
He does not urge without a reason (A IV 32) and so on.
He is wholly solicitous of welfare and partial to progress.
62.	Because of the words beginning, "Ananda, it is owing to my being a good
friend to them that living beings subject to birth are freed from birth" (SI 88), it is
only the Fully Enlightened One wh|o possesses all the aspects of the good friend.
Since that is so, while he is available only a meditation subject taken in the Blessed
One's presence is well taken.
But after his final attainment of Nibbana, it is proper to take it from anyone of
the eighty great disciples still living. When they are no more available, one who
wants to take a particular meditation subject should take it from someone with
cankers destroyed, who has, by means of that particular meditation subject,
produced the fourfold and fivefold jhana, and has reached the destruction of cankers
by augmenting insight that had that jhana as its proximate cause.
63.	But how then, does someone with cankers destroyed declare himself thus: "I am
one whose cankers are destroyed?" Wlw not? He declares himself when he knows
that his instructions will be carried out. Did not the Elder Assagutta [99] spread out
his leather mat in the air and sitting cross-legged on it explain a meditation subject to
a bhikkhu who was starting his meditation subject, because he knew that that bhikkhu
was one who would carry out his instructions for the meditation subject?
64. So if someone with cankers destroyed is available, that is good. If not, then
one should take it from a non-returner, a once-returner, a stream-enterer, an
ordinary man who has obtained jhana, one who knows three Pitakas, one who
knows two Pitakas, one who knows one Pitaka, in descending order [according as
available]. If not even one who knows one Pitaka is available, then it should be
taken from one who is familiar with one Collection together with its commentary
and one who is himself conscientious. For a teacher such as this, who knows the
texts, guards the heritage, and protects the tradition, will follow the teachers'
opinion rather than his own. Hence the Ancient Elders said three times, "One who
is conscientious will guard it."

Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
65.	Now, those beginning with one whose cankers are destroyed, mentioned above,
will describe only the path they have themselves reached. But with a learned man,
his instructions and his answers to questions are purified by his having approached
such and such teachers, and so he will explain a meditation subject showing a
broad track, like a big elephant going through a stretch of jungle, and he will select
suttas and reasons from here and there, adding [explanations of] what is suitable
and unsuitable. So a meditation subject should be taken by approaching the good
friend such as this, the giver of a meditation subject, and by doing all the duties to
him.
66.	If he is available in the same monastery it is good. If not, one should go to
where he lives.
When [a bhikkhu] goes to him, he should not do so with feet washed and
anointed, wearing sandals, with an umbrella, surrounded by pupils, and bringing
oil tube, honey, molasses, etc.; he should do so fulfilling the duties of a bhikkhu
setting out on a journey carrying his bowl and robes himself, doing all the duties
in each monastery on the way, with few belongings, and living in the greatest
effacement. When entering that monastery he should do so [expecting nothing,
and even provided] with a tootli-stick that he has had made allowable on the wav
[according to the rules]. And he should not enter some other room, thinking, "I
shall go to the teacher after resting awhile and after washing and anointing my
feet, and so on."
67.	Why? If there are bhikkhus there who are hostile to the teacher, they might
ask him the reason for his coming and speak dispraise of the teacher, saving, "You
are done for if you go to him"; [100] they might make him regret his coming and
turn him back. So he should ask for t|he teacher's dwelling and go straight there.
68.	If the teacher is junior, he should not consent to the teacher's receiving his
bowl and robe, and so on. If the teacher is senior, then he should go and pay homage
to him and remain standing. When told, "Put down the bowl and robe, friend," he
may put them down. When told, "Have some water to drink," he can drink if he
wants to. When told, "You may wash your feet," he should not do so at once, for if
the water has been brought by the teacher himself, it would be improper. But when
told "Wash, friend, it was not brought by me, it was brought by others," then he
can wash his feet, sitting in a screened place out of sight of the teacher, or in the
open to one side of the dwelling.
69.	If the teacher brings an oil tube, he should get up and take it carefully with
both hands. If he did not take it, it might make the teacher wonder, "Does this
bhikkhu resent sharing so soon?" but having taken it, he should not anoint his feet
at once. For if it were oil for anointing the teacher's limbs, it would not be proper.
So he should first anoint his head, then his shoulders, etc.; but when told, "This is
meant for all the limbs, friend, anoint vour feet," he should put a little on his head
and then anoint his feet. Then he should give it back, saying when the teacher
takes it, "May I return this oil tube, venerable sir?"
70.	He should not say "Explain a meditation subject to me, venerable sir" on the
very day he arrives. But starting from the next day he can, if the teacher has a
`96
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
habitual attendant, ask his permission to do the duties. If he does not allow it
when asked, they can be done when the opportunity offers. When he does them,
three tooth-sticks should be brought, a small, a medium and a big one, and two
kinds of mouth-washing water and bathing water, that is, hot and cold, should be
set out. Whichever of these the teacher uses for three days should then be brought
regularly If the teacher uses either kind indiscriminately he can bring whatever is
available.
71. Why so many words? All should be done as prescribed by the Blessed One in
the Khandhakas as the right duties in the passage beginning: "Bhikkhus, a pupil
should perform the duties to the teacher [101] rightly Herein, this is the right
performance of duties. He should rise early; removing his sandals and arranging
his robe on one shoulder, he should give the tooth-sticks and the mouth-washing
water, and he should prepare the seat. If there is rice gruel, he should wash the
dish and bring the rice gruel" (Vin I 61).
72.	To please the teacher by perfection in the duties he should pay homage in the
evening, and he should leave when dismissed with the words, "You may go." When
the teacher asks him, "Wliv have you come?" he can explain the reason for his
coming. If he does not ask but agrees to the duties being done, then after ten days
or a fortnight have gone by he should make an opportunity by staving back one
day at the time of his dismissal, and announcing the reason for his coming; or he
should go at an unaccustomed time, and when asked, "What have you come for?"
he can announce it.
73.	If the teacher says, "Come in the morning," he should do so. But if his stomach
burns with a bile affliction at that hour, or if his food does not get digested owing
to sluggish digestive heat, or if some other ailment afflicts him, he should let it be
known, and proposing a time that suits himself, he should come at that time. For if
a meditation subject is expounded at an inconvenient time, one cannot give attention.
This is the detailed explanation of the words "approach the good friend, the
giver of a meditation subject."
74.	Now, as to the words, one that suits his temperament (§28): there are six kinds of
temperament, that is, greedy temperament, hating temperament, deluded
temperament, faithful temperament, intelligent temperament, and speculative
temperament. Some would have fourteen, taking these six single ones together
with the four made up of the three double combinations and one triple combination
with the greed triad and likewise with the faith triad. But if this classification is
admitted, there are many more kinds of temperament possible by combining greed,
etc., with faith, etc.; therefore the kinds of temperament should be understood
briefly as only six. As to meaning the temperaments are one, that is to say personal
nature, idiosyncrasy According to [102] these there are only six types of persons,
that is, one of greedy temperament, one of hating temperament, one of deluded
temperament, one of faithful temperament, one of intelligent temperament, and
one of speculative temperament.
75. Herein, one of faithful temperament is parallel to one of greedy temperament
because faith is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of greedy
`97
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of greed. For, in an
unprofitable way, greed is affectionate and not over-austere, and so, in a profitable
way is faith. Greed seeks out sense desires as object, while faith seeks out the
special qualities of virtue and so on. And greed does not give up what is harmful,
while faith does not give up what is beneficial.
76. One of intelligent temperament is parallel to one of hating temperament
because understanding is strong when profitable [kamma] occurs in one of hating
temperament, owing to its special qualities being near to those of hate. For, in an
unprofitable way, hate is disaffected and does not hold to its object, and so, in a
profitable way, is understanding. Hate seeks out only unreal faults, while
understanding seeks out onlv real faults. And hate occurs in the mode of
condemning living beings, while understanding occurs in the mode of condemning
formations.
77.	One of speculative temperament is parallel to one of deluded temperament
because obstructive applied thoughts arise often in one of deluded temperament
who is striving to arouse unarisen profitable states, owing to their special qualities
being near to those of delusion. For just as delusion is restless owing to perplexity,
so are applied thoughts that are due to thinking over various aspects. And just as
delusion vacillates owing to superficiality so do applied thoughts that are due to
facile conjecturing.
78.	Others say that there are three more kinds of temperament with craving, pride,
and views. Herein craving is simply greed; and pride18 is associated with that, so
neither of them exceeds greed. And since views have their source in delusion, the
temperament of views falls within the deluded temperament.
79.	What is the source of these temperaments? And how is it to be known that
such a person is of greedv temperament, that such a person is of one of those
beginning with hating temperament? What suits one of what kind of temperament?
80.	Herein, as some say19 the first three kinds of temperament to begin with have
their source in previous habit; and they have their source in elements and humours.
Apparently one of greedy temperament has formerly had plenty of desirable tasks
and gratifying work to do, or has reappeared here after dying in a heaven. And one
18.	Mnim, usually rendered by "pride," is rendered here both by "pride" and "conceit."
Etvmologicallv it is derived perhaps from maneti (to honour) or minati (to measure). In
sense, however, it tends to become associated with mannati, to conceive (false notions,
see M11), to imagine, to think (as e.g. at Nidd 180, Vibh 390 and corny). As one of the
"defilements" (see M I 36) it is probably best rendered by "pride." In the expression
asmi-mana (often rendered by "the pride that says T am'") it more nearly approaches
mannana (false imagining, misconception, see M III 246) and is better rendered by the
"conceit T am/" since the word "conceit" straddles both the meanings of "pride" (i.e.
haughtiness) and "conception."
19.	"'Some' is said with reference to the Elder Upatissa. For it is put in this way by
him in the Vimuttimagga. The word 'apparently' indicates dissent from what follows"
(Vism-mht 103). A similar passage to that referred to appears in Ch. 6 (Taisho ed. p. 410a)
of the Chinese version of the Vimuttimagga, the only one extant.
`98
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
of hating temperament has formerly had plenty of stabbing and torturing and
brutal work to do or has reappeared here after dying in one of the hells or the naga
(serpent) existences. And one [103] of deluded temperament has formerly drunk a
lot of intoxicants and neglected learning and questioning, or has reappeared here
after dying in the animal existence. It is in this way that they have their source in
previous habit, they say.
81. Then a person is of deluded temperament because two elements are
prominent, that is to say the earth element and the water element. He is of hating
temperament because the other two elements are prominent. But he is of greedy
temperament because all four are equal. And as regards the humours, one of greedy
temperament has phlegm in excess and one of deluded temperament has wind in
excess. Or one of deluded temperament has phlegm in excess and one of greedy
temperament has wind in excess. So they have their source in the elements and the
humours, they say.
82.	[Now, it can rightly be objected that] not all of those who have had plenty of
desirable tasks and gratifying work to do, and who have reappeared here after
dying in a heaven, are of greedy temperament, or the others respectively of hating
and deluded temperament; and there is no such law of prominence of elements
(see XIV43f.) as that asserted; and onlv the pair, greed and delusion, are given in
the law of humours, and even that subsequently contradicts itself; and no source
for even one among those beginning with one of faithful temperament is given.
Consequently this definition is indecisive.
83.	The following is the exposition according to the opinion of the teachers of the
commentaries; or this is said in the "explanation of prominence": "The fact that
these beings have prominence of greed, prominence of hate, prominence of delusion,
is governed by previous root-cause.
"For when in one man, at the moment of his accumulating [rebirth-producing]
kamma, greed is strong and non-greed is weak, non-hate and non-delusion are
strong and hate and delusion are weak, then his weak non-greed is unable to prevail
over his greed, but his non-hate and non-delusion being strong are able to prevail
over his hate and delusion. That is why, on being reborn through rebirth-linking
given by that kamma, he has greed, is good-natured and unangry and possesses
understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash.
84. "When, at the moment of another's accumulating kamma, greed and hate are
strong and non-greed and non-hate weak, and non-delusion is strong and delusion
weak, then in the way already stated he has both greed and hate but possesses
understanding with knowledge like a lightning flash, like the Elder Datta-Abhaya.
"When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, greed, non-hate and delusion
are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already stated he both has
greed and is dull but is good-tempered20 and unangry like the Elder Bahula.
20.| Silaka—"good-tempered"—sukhasila (good-natured—see §83), which = sakhila
(kindly—Vism-mht 104). Not in PED.
`99
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three, namely,
greed, hate and delusion are strong and non-greed, etc., are weak, then in the way
already stated he has both greed and hate and is deluded. [104]
85. "When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, hate and
delusion are strong and the others are weak, then in the way already stated he has
little defilement and is unshakable evjen on seeing a heavenly object, but he has
hate and is slow in understanding.
"When, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, non-hate and
non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he has
no greed and no hate, and is good-tempered but slow in understanding.
"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, non-greed, hate
and non-delusion are strong and the rest weak, then in the way already stated he
both has no greed and possesses understanding but has hate and is irascible.
"Likewise when, at the moment of his accumulating kamma, the three, that is,
non-hate, non-greed, and non-delusion, are strong and greed, etc., are weak, then
in the wav already stated he has no greed and no hate and possesses understanding,
like the Elder Maha-Saiigharakkhita."
86.	One who, as it is said here, "has greed" is one of greedy temperament; one
who "has hate" and one who "is dull" are respectively of hating temperament and
deluded temperament. One who "possesses understanding" is one of intelligent
temperament. One who "has no greed" and one who "has no hate" are of faithful
temperament because they are naturally trustful. Or just as one who is reborn
through kamma accompanied by non-delusion is of intelligent temperament, so
one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by strong faith is of faithful
temperament, one who is reborn through kamma accompanied by thoughts of
sense desire is of speculative temperament, and one who is reborn through kamma
accompanied by mixed greed, etc., is of mixed temperament. So it is the kamma
productive of rebirth-linking and accompanied by someone among the things
beginning with greed that should be understood as the source of the temperaments.
87.	But it was asked, and how is it to he known that "This person is of greedy
temperament?" (§79), and so on. This is explained as follows:
Bv the posture, by the action,
Bv eating, seeing, and so on,
By the kind of states occurring,
May temperament be recognized.
88. Herein, by the posture: when one of greedy temperament is walking in his
usual manner, he walks carefully puts his foot down slowly, puts it down evenly
lifts it up evenly and his step is springy.21
One of hating temperament walks as though he were digging with the points of his
feet, puts his foot down quickl|y lifts it up quickly and his step is dragged along.
21. Ukkutika—"springy" is glossed here by asampliuttliamajjiiam ("not touching in the
middle"—Vism-mht 106). This meaning is not in PED.
`100
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
One of deluded temperament walks with a perplexed gait, puts his foot down hesitantly
lifts it up hesitantly [105] and liis step is pressed down suddenly
And this is said in the account of the origin of the Magandiya Sutta:
The step of one of greedy nature will be springy;
The step of one of hating nature, dragged along;
Deluded, he will suddenly press down his step;
And one without defilement has a step like this.22
89. The stance of one of greedy temperament is confident and graceful. That of one
of hating temperament is rigid. That of one of deluded temperament is muddled,
likewise in sitting. And one of greedy temperament spreads his bed unhurriedly lies
down slowly composing his limbs, and he sleeps in a confident manner. When woken,
instead of getting up quickly he gives his answer slowly as though doubtful. One of
hating temperament spreads his bed hastily anyhow; with his body flung down he
sleeps with a scowl. When woken, he gets up quickly and answers as though annoyed.
One of deluded temperament spreads his bed all awry and sleeps mostly face
downwards with his body sprawling. When woken, he gets up slowly saying, "Hum."
90.	Since those of faithful temperament, etc., are parallel to those of greedy
temperament, etc., their postures are therefore like those described above.
This firstly is how the temperaments may be recognized by the posture.
91.	By the action: also in the acts of sweeping, etc., one of greedy temperament
grasps the broom well, and he sweeps cleanly and evenly without hurrying or
scattering the sand, as if he were strewing sinduvara flowers. One of hating
temperament grasps the broom tightly, and he sweeps uncleanly and unevenly
with a harsh noise, hurriedly throwing up the sand on each side. One of deluded
temperament grasps the broom loosely, and he sweeps neither cleanly nor evenly
mixing the sand up and turning it over.
92.	As with sweeping, so too with anv action such as washing and dyeing robes,
and so on. One of greedy temperament acts skilfully, gently, evenly and carefully
One of hating temperament acts tensely stiffly and unevenly. One of deluded
temperament acts unskilfully as if muddled, unevenly and indecisively. [106]
Also one of greedy temperament wears his robe neither too tightly nor too
loosely, confidently and level all round. One of hating temperament wears it too
tight and not level all round. One of deluded temperament wears it loosely and in
a muddled way.
Those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way as
those just described, since they are parallel.
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the actions.
93. By eating: One of greedy temperament likes eating rich sweet food. When
eating, he makes a round lump not too big and eats unhurriedly savouring the
various tastes. He enjoys getting something good. One of hating temperament likes
eating rough sour food. When eating he makes a lump that fills his mouth, and he
22. See Sn-a 544, A-a 436.
`101
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
eats hurriedly without savouring the taste. He is aggrieved when he gets something
not good. One of deluded temperament has no settled choice. When eating, he
makes a small un-rounded lump, and as he eats he drops bits into his dish, smearing
his face, with his mind astray, thinking of this and that.
Also those of faithful temperament, etc., should be undeijstood in the same way
as those just described since they are parallel.
This is how the temperament may be recognized by eating.
94. And by seeing and so on: when one of greedy temperament sees even a slightly
pleasing visible object, he looks long as if surprised, he seizes on trivial virtues,
discounts genuine faults, and when departing, he does so with regret as if unwilling
to leave. When one of hating temperament sees even a slightly unpleasing visible
object, he avoids looking long as if he were tired, he picks out trivial faults, discounts
genuine virtues, and when departing, he does so without regret as if anxious to
leave. When one of deluded temperament sees any sort of visible object, he copies
what others do: if he hears others criticizing, he criticizes; if he hears others praising,
he praises; but actually he feels equanimity in himself—the equanimity of
unknowing. So too with sounds, and so on.
And those of faithful temperament, etc., should be understood in the same way
as those just described since they are parallel.
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by seeing and so on.
95. By the kind of states occurring: in one of greedy temperament there is frequent
occurrence of such states as deceit, fraud, pride, evilness of wishes, greatness of
wishes, discontent, foppery and personal vanity.23 [107] In one of hating
temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as anger, enmity,
disparaging, domineering, envy and avarice. In one of deluded temperament there
is frequent occurrence of such states as stiffness, torpor, agitation, worry uncertainty
and holding on tenaciously with refusal to relinquish.
23. Singa—"foppery" is not in PED in this sense. See Vibh 351 and commentary
—rr'-*: ----------——.............— — --------------------.......*■
Capalya (capalla)—"personal vanity": noun from adj. capala. The word "cupula" comes
in an often-repeated passage: "satha ntayavino ketnbhino uddhata unnala capala nmkliara
..."(MI 32); cf. S I 203; A III 199, etc.) and also M1470 "uddhato hoti capalo/' with two
lines lower "uddhaccam capalyarn" Capalya also occurs at Vibh 351 (and MII167). At M-
a 1152 (commenting on M132) we find: capala ti pattacwaramandanadina capallena yutta
("interested in personal vanity consisting in adorning bowl and robe and so on"), and
at M-a III 185 (commenting on M1470): Uddhato hoti capalo ti uddhaccapakatiko c'eva hoti
clvaramandana pattarnandana senasanamandana imassa va putikayassa kelayananiandana ti
evain vuttena tanmadarakacapallma samannagato ('"he is distracted—or puffed up—and
personally vain': he is possessed of the callow youth's personal vanity described as
adorning the robe, adorning the bowl, adorning the lodging, or prizing and adorning
tills filthy body"). This meaning is [confirmed in the commentary to Vibh 251. PED
does not give this meaning at all but only "fickle," which is unsupported by the
commentary CPD (acapala) also does not give this meaning.
As to the other things listed here in the Visnddliimagga text, most will be found at M
I 36. For "holding on tenaciously," etc., see M143.
`102
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
In one of faithful temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as
free generosity, desire to see Noble Ones, desire to hear the Good Dhamma, great
gladness, ingenuousness, honesty and trust in things that inspire trust. In one of
intelligent temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as readiness to
be spoken to, possession of good friends, knowledge of the right amount in eating,
mindfulness and full awareness, devotion to wakefulness, a sense of urgency about
things that should inspire a sense of urgency and wisely directed endeavour. In
one of speculative temperament there is frequent occurrence of such states as
talkativeness, sociability boredom with devotion to the profitable, failure to finish
undertakings, smoking by night and flaming by day (see M I 144—that is to say,
hatching plans at night and putting them into effect by day), and mental running
hither and thither (see Ud 37).
This is how the temperaments may be recognized by the kind of states occurring.
96.	However, these directions for recognizing the temperaments have not been handed
down in their entire tv in either the texts or the commentaries; they are only expressed
according to the opinion of the teachers and cannot therefore be heated as authentic.
For even those of hating temperament can exhibit postures, etc., ascribed to the greedy
temperament when they try diligently And postures, etc., never arise with distinct
characteristics in a person of mixed temperament. Onlv such directions for recognizing
temperament as are given in the commentaries should be heated as authentic; for this
is said: "A teacher who has acquired penetration of minds will know the temperament
and will explain a meditation subject accordingly; one who has not should question
the pupil." So it is by penetration of minds or by questioning the person, that it can be
known whether he is one of greedy temperament or one of those beginning with
hating temperament.]
97.	What suits one of what kind of temperament? (§79). A suitable lodging for one of
greedy temperament has an unwashed sill and stands level with the ground, and
it can be either an overhanging [rock with an] unprepared [drip-ledge] (see Ch. II,
note 15), a grass hut, or a leaf house, etc. It ought to be spattered with dirt, full of
bats,24 dilapidated, too high or too low, in bleak surroundings, threatened [by lions,
tigers, etc.,] with a muddy uneven path, [108] where even the bed and chair are full
of bugs. And it should be ugly and unsightly, exciting loathing as soon as looked
at. Suitable inner and outer garments are those that have torn-off edges with threads
hanging down all round like a "net cake,"25 harsh to the touch like hemp, soiled,
heavy and hard to wear. And the right kind of bowl for him is an ugly clay bowl
disfigured by stoppings and joints, or a heavy and misshapen iron bowl as
unappetizing as a skull. The right kind of road for him on which to wander for
alms is disagreeable, with no village near, and uneven. The right kind of village for
him in which to wander for alms is where people wander about as if oblivious of
him, where, as he is about to leave without getting alms even from a single [family
people call him into the sitting hall, saying, "Come, venerable sir," and give him

what is now known in Sri Lanka as a "string hopper," or something like it.

Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
gruel and rice, but do so as casually as if they were putting a cow in a pen. Suitable
people to serve him are slaves or workmen who are unsightly, ill-favoured, with
dirty clothes, ill-smelling and disgusting, who serve him his gruel and rice as if
they were throwing it rudely at him. The right kind of gruel and rice and hard
food is poor, unsightly made up of millet, kudusaka, broken rice, etc., stale buttermilk,
sour gruel, curry of old vegetables, or anvthing at all that is merely for filling the
stomach. The right kind of posture for him is either standing or walking. The object
of his contemplation should be any of the colour kasinas, beginning with the blue,
whose colour is not pure. This is what suits one of greedy temperament.
98. A suitable resting place for one of hating temperament is not too high or too
low, provided with shade and water, with well-proportioned walls, posts and steps,
with well-prepared frieze work and lattice work, brightened with various kinds of
painting, with an even, smooth, soft floor, adorned with festoons of flowers and a
canopy of many-coloured cloth like a Brahma-god's divine palace, with bed and
chair covered with well-spread clean pretty covers, smelling sweetly of flowers,
and perfumes and scents set about for homely comfort, which makes one happy
and glad at the mere sight of it.
99. The right kind of road to his lodging is free from any sort of danger, traverses
clean, even ground, and has been properly prepared. [109] And here it is best that
the lodging's furnishings are not too many in order to avoid hiding-places for
insects, bugs, snakes and rats: even a single bed and chair only. The right kind of
inner and outer garments for him are of any superior stuff such as China cloth,
Somara cloth, silk, fine cotton, fine linen, of either single or double thickness, quite
light, and well dyed, quite pure in colour to befit an ascetic. The right kind of bowl
is made of iron, as well shaped as a water bubble, as polished as a gem, spotless,
and of quite pure colour to befit an ascetic. The right kind of road on which to
wander for alms is free from dangers, level, agreeable, with the village neither too
far nor too near. The right kind of village in which to wander for alms is where
people, thinking, "Now our lord is coming," prepare a seat in a sprinkled, swept
place, and going out to meet him, take his bowl, lead him to the house, seat him on
a prepared seat and serve him carefully with their own hands.
100.	Suitable people to serve him are handsome, pleasing, well bathed, well
anointed, scented26 with the perfume of incense and the smell of flowers, adorned
with apparel made of variously-dyed clean pretty cloth, who do their work carefully
The right kind of gruel, rice, and hard food has colour, smell and taste, possesses
nutritive essence, and is inviting, superior in every way and enough for his wants.
The right kind of posture for him is lying down or sitting. The object of his
contemplation should be anyone of the colour kasinas, beginning with the blue,
whose colour is quite pure. This is what suits one of hating temperament.
101.	The right lodging for one of deluded temperament has a view and is not shut
in, where the four quarters are visible to him as he sits there. As to the postures, walking
is right. The right kind of object for his contemplation is not small, that is to say the
size of a winnowing basket or the size of a saucer; for his mind becomes more confused
26. Surabhi—"scented, perfume": not in PED; also at VI.90; X.60 and Vism-mht 445.
`103
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
in a confined space; so the right kind is an amply large kasina. The rest is as stated for
one of hating temperament. This is what suits one of deluded temperament.
102. For one of faithful temperament all the directions given for one of hating
temperament are suitable. As to the object of his contemplation, one of the
recollections is right as well.
For one of intelligent temperament there is nothing unsuitable as far as concerns
the lodging and so on.
For one of speculative temperament an open lodging with a view, [110] where
gardens, groves and ponds, pleasant prospects, panoramas of villages, towns and
countryside, and the blue gleam of mountains, are visible to him as he sits there, is
not right; for that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought.
So he should live in a lodging such as a deep cavern screened by woods like the
Overhanging Rock of the Elephant's Belly (Hatthikucchipabbhara), or Mahinda's
Cave. Also an ample-sized object of contemplation is not suitable for him; for one
like that is a condition for the running hither and thither of applied thought. A
small one is right. The rest is as stated for one of greedy temperament. This is what
suits one of speculative temperament.
These are the details, with definition of the kind, source, recognition, and what
is suitable, as regards the various temperaments handed down here with the words
"that suits his own temperament" (§60).
103. However, the meditation subject that is suitable to the temperament has not
been cleared up in all its aspects yet. This will become clear automatically when
those in the following list are treated in detail.
Now, it was said above, "and he should apprehend from among the forty
meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament" (§60). Here the exposition
of the meditation subject should be first understood in thes^ ten ways: (1) as to
enumeration, (2) as to which bring only access and which absorption, (3) at to the
kinds of jhana, (4) as to surmounting, (5) as to extension and non-extension, (6) as
to object, (7) as to plane, (8) as to apprehending, (9) as to condition, (10) as to
suitability to temperament.
104.	1. Herein, as to enumeration: it was said above, "from among the forty
meditation subjects" (§28). Herein, the forty meditation subjects are these:
ten kasinas (totalities),
ten kinds of foulness,
ten recollections,
four divine abidings,
four immaterial states,
one perception,
one defining.
105.	Herein, the ten kasinas are these: earth kasina, water kasina, fire kasina, air
kasina, blue kasina, yellow kasina, red kasina, white kasina, light kasina, and
limited-space kasina.27
27. "'Kasina' is in the sense of entirety (sakalatthena)" (M-a III 260). See IV119.
`105
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
The ten kinds of foulness are these: the bloated, the livid, the festering, the cut-
up, the gnawed, the scattered, the hacked and scattered, the bleeding, the worm-
infested, and a skeleton.28
The ten kinds of recollection are these: recollection of the Buddha (the
Enlightened One), [recollection of the Dhamma (the Law), recollection of the Sangha
(the Community), recollection of virtue, recollection of generosity recollection of
deities, recollection (or mindfulness) of death, mindfulness occupied with the bodv,
mindfulness of breathing, and recollection of peace. [Ill]
The four divine abidings are these: loving-kindness, compassion, gladness, and
equanimity.
The four immaterial states are these: the base consisting of boundless space, the
base consisting of boundless consciousness, the base consisting of nothingness,
and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception.
The one perception is the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment.
The one defining is the defining of the four elements.
This is how the exposition should be understood "as to enumeration."
106.	2 As to which bring access only and which absorption: the eight recollections—
excepting mindfulness occupied with the body and mindfulness of breathing—
the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, and the defining of the four elements,
are ten meditation subjects that bring access only. The others bring absorption.
This is "as to which bring access only and which absorption."
107.	3. As to the kind of jhana: among those that bring absorption, the ten kasinas
together with mindfulness of breathing bring all four jhanas. The ten kinds of
foulness together with mindfulness occupied with the body bring the first jhana.
28. Here ten kinds of foulness are given. But in the Suttas only either five or six of this
set appear to be mentioned, that is, "Perception of a skeleton, perception of the worm-
infested, perception of the livid, perception of the cut-up, perception of the bloated,
(see A I 42 and S V 131; A II 17 adds "perception of the festering")" No details are
given. All ten appear at Dhs 263-64 and Patis I 49. It will be noted that no order of
progress of decay in the kinds of corpse appears here; also the instructions in Ch. VI
are for contemplating actual corpses in these states. The primary purpose here is to
cultivate "repulsiveness."
Another set of nine progressive stages in the decay of a corpse, mostly different
from these, is given at M158,89, etc., beginning with a corpse one day old and ending
with bones turned to dust. From the words "suppose a bhikkhu saw a corpse thrown
on a charnel ground ... he compares this same body of his with it thus, This body too
is of like nature, awaits a like fate, is not exempt from that'"(M 158), it can be assumed
that these nine, which are given in progressive order of decay in order to demonstrate
the body's impermanence, are not necessarily intended as contemplations of actual
corpses so much as mental im|ages to be created, the primary purpose being to cultivate
impermanence. This may be why these nine are not used here (see VIII.43).
The word asubfia (foul, foulness) is used both of the contemplations of corpses as
here and of the contemplation of the parts of the body (A V 109).
`106
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
The first three divine abidings bring three jhanas. The fourth divine abiding and
the four immaterial states bring the fourth jhana. This is "as to the kind of jhana."
108. 4. As to surmounting: there are two kinds of surmounting, that is to say,
surmounting of factors and surmounting of object. Herein, there is surmounting
of factors in the case of all meditation subjects that bring three and four jhanas
because the second jhana, etc., have to be reached in those same objects by
surmounting the jhana factors of applied thought and sustained thought, and so
on. Likewise in the case of the fourth divine abiding; for that has to be reached by
surmounting joy in the same object as that of loving-kindness, and so on. But in
the case of the four immaterial states there is surmounting of the object; for the
base consisting of boundless space has to be reached by surmounting one or other
of the first nine kasinas, and the base consisting of boundless consciousness, etc.,
have respectively to be reached by surmounting space, and so on. With the rest
there is no surmounting. This is "as to surmounting."
109.	5. As to extension and non-extension: only the ten kasinas among these forty
meditation subjects need be extended. For it is within just so much space as one is
intent upon with the kasina that one can hear sounds with the divine ear element,
see visible objects with the divine eye, and know the minds of other beings with
the mind.
110.	Mindfulness occupied with the body and the ten kinds of foulness need not be
extended. Why? Because they have a definite location and because there is no benefit
in it. The definiteness of their location will become clear in explaining the method of
development (VIII.83-138 and VI.40, 41, 79). If the latter are extended, it is onlv a
quantity of corpses that is extended [112] and there is no benefit. And this is said in
answer to the question of Sopaka: "Perception of visible forms is quite clear, Blessed
One, perception of bones is not clear" (Source untraced29); for here the perception of
visible forms is called "quite clear" in the sense of extension of the sign, while the
perception of bones is called "not quite clear" in the sense of its non-extension.
111.	But the words "I was intent upon this whole earth with the perception of a
skeleton" (Th 18) are said of the manner of appearance to one who has acquired
that perception. For just as in [the Emperor] Dhammasoka's time the Karavlka bird
uttered a sweet song when it saw its own reflection in the looking glass walls all
round and perceived Karavlkas in every direction,30 so the Elder [Sirigala Pitar]
29.	Also quoted in A-a V 79 on AN 11:9. Cf. Sn 1119. A similar quotation with Sopaka
is found in Vism-mht 334-35, see note 1 to XI.2.
30.	The full story which occurs at M-a III 382-83 and elsewhere, is this: "It seems that
when the Karavlka bird has pecked a sweet-flavoured mango wth its beak and savoured
the dripping juice, and flapping its wings, begins to sing, then quadrupeds caper as if
mad. Quadrupeds grazing in their pastures drop the grass in their mouths and listen
to the sound. Beasts of prey hunting small animals pause with one foot raised. Him ted
animals lose their fear of death and halt in their tracks. Birds flying in the air stay with
wings outstretched. Fishes in the water keep still, not moving their fins. All listen to
the sound, so beautiful is the Karavlka's song. Dhammasoka's queen Asandhamitta
asked the Community: 'Venerable sirs, is there anything that sounds like the Buddha?'—
'The Karavlka birds does.'—'Where are those birds, venerable sirs?'—'In the Himalaya.'
`107
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
thought, when he saw the sign appearing in all directions through his acquisition
of the perception of a skeleton, that the whole earth was covered with bones.
112.	If that is so, then is what is called "the measurelessness of the object of jhana
produced on foulness"31 contradicted? It is not contradicted. For one man
apprehends the sign in a large bloated corpse or skeleton, another in a small one.
In this wav the jhana of the one has a limited object and of the other a measureless
object. Or alternatively "With a measureless object" (Dhs 182-84 in elision) is said
of it referring to one who extends it, seeing no disadvantage in doing so. But it
need not be extended because no benefit results.
113.	The rest need not be extended likewise. Why? When a man extends the sign
of in-breaths and out-breaths, only a quantity of wind is extended, and it has a
definite location, [the nose-tip]. So it need not be extended because of the
disadvantage and because of the definiteness of the location. And the divine
abidings have living beings as their object. When a man extends the sign of these,
only the quantity of living beings would be extended, and there is no purpose in
that. So that also need not be extended.
114.	When it is said, "Intent upon one quarter with his heart endued with loving-
kindness" (D1250), etc., that is said for the sake of comprehensive inclusion. For it
is when a man develops it progressively by including living beings in one direction
by one house, by two houses, etc., that he is said to be "intent upon one direction,"
[113] not when he extends the sign. And there is no counterpart sign here that he
might extend. Also the state of having a limited or measureless object can be
understood here according to the wav of inclusion, too.
115.	As regards the immaterial states as object, space need not be extended since
it is the mere removal of the kasina [materiality]; for that should be brought to
mind onlv as the disappearanc|e of the kasina [materiality]; if he extends it, nothing
further happens. And consciousness need not be extended since it is a state
consisting in an individual essence, and it is not possible to extend a state consisting
in an individual essence. The disappearance of consciousness need not be extended
since it is mere non-existence of consciousness. And the base consisting of neither
--
She told the king: 'Sire, I wish to hear a Karavlka bird.' The king dispatched a gold
cage with the order, 'Let a Karavlka bird come and sit in this cage.' The cage travelled
and halted in front of a Karavlka. Thinking, 'The cage has come at the king's command;
it is impossible not to go,' the bird got in. The cage returned and stopped before the
king. They could not get the Karavlka to utter a sound. When the king asked, 'When
do they utter a sound?' they replied, 'On seeing their kin.' Then the king had it
surrounded with looking-glasses. Seeing its own reflection and imagining that its
relatives had come, it flapped its wings and cried out with an exquisite voice as if
sounding a crystal trumpet. All the people in the city rushed about as if mad.
Asandliamitta thought: 'If the sound of this creature is so fine, what indeed can the
sound of the Blessed [One have been like since he had reached the glory of omniscient
knowledge?' and arousing a happiness that she never again relinquished, she became
established in the fruition of stream-entry."

38, §182 and §184.
`108
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
perception nor non-perception as object need not be extended since it too is a state
consisting in an individual essence.32
116.	The rest need not be extended because they have no sign. For it is the
counterpart sign33 that would be extendable, and the object of the recollection of
the Buddha, etc., is not a counterpart sign. Consequently there is no need for
extension there.
This is "as to extension and non-extension."
117.	6. As to object: of these forty meditation subjects, twenty-two have counterpart
signs as object, that is to say the ten kasinas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness of
breathing, and mindfulness occupied with the body; the rest do not have counterpart
signs as object. Then twelve have states consisting in individual essences as object, that
is to say eight of the ten recollections—except mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness
occupied with the body—the perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, the defining
of the elements, the base consisting of boundless consciousness, and the base consisting
of neither perception nor non-perception; and twenty-two have [counterpart] signs as
object, that is to say the ten kasinas, the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness of breathing,
and mindfulness occupied with the body; while the remaining six have "not-so-
classifiable"34 objects. Then eight have mobile objects in the early stage though the
counterpart is stationary, that is to say the festering, the bleeding, the worm-infested,
mindfulness of breathing, the water kasina, the fire kasina, the air kasina, and in the
case of the light kasina the object consisting of a circle of sunlight, etc.; the rest have
immobile objects.35 This is "as to object."
118. 7. As to plane: here the twelve, namely the ten kinds of foulness, mindfulness
occupied with the body and perception of repulsiveness in nutriment, do not occur
among deities. These twelve and mindfulness of breathing do not occur in the
32. "It is because only an abstract (parikappaja) object can be extended, not any other
kind, that he said, 'it is not possible to extend a state consisting in an individual essence'"
(Vism-mht 110).
33.	The word "nimitta" in its technical sense is consistently rendered here bv the word
"sign," which corresponds very nearly if not exactly to most uses of it. It is sometimes
rendered by "mark" (which over-emphasizes the concrete), and by "image" (which is
not always intended). The three kinds, that is, the preliminary-work sign, learning sign
and counterpart sign, do not appear in the Pitakas. There the use rather suggests
association of ideas as, for example, at M I 180, M I 119, A I 4, etc., than the more
definitely visualized "image" in some instances of the "counterpart sign" described in
the following chapters.
34.	Na-vattabba—"not so-classifiable" is an Abhidhamma shorthand term for
something that, when considered under one of the triads or dyads of the Abhidhamma
Matika (Dhs If.), cannot be placed under any one of the three, or two, headings.
35.	"'The festering' is a mobile object because of the oozing of the pus, 'the bleeding'
because of the trickling of the blood, 'the worm-infested' because of the wriggling of the
worms. The mobile aspect of the sunshine coming in through a window opening is
evident, which explains why an object consisting of a circle of sunlight is called mobile"
(Vism-mht 110).
`109
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
Brahma-world. But none except the four immaterial states occur in the immaterial
becoming. All occur among human beings. This is "as to plane." [114]
119. 8. As to apprehending: here the exposition should be understood according
to the seen, the touched and the heard. Herein, these nineteen, that is to say, nine
kasinas omitting the air kasina and the ten kinds of foulness, must be apprehended
by the seen. The meaning is that in the early stage their sign must be apprehended
by constantly looking with the eye. In the case of mindfulness occupied with the
body the five parts ending with skin must be apprehended by the seen and the rest
by the heard, so its object must be apprehended by the seen and the heard.
Mindfulness of breathing must be apprehended by the touched; the air kasina by
the seen and the touched; the remaining eighteen by the heard. The divine abiding
of equanimity and the four immaterial states are not appreliendable by a beginner;
but the remaining thirty-five are. This is "as to apprehending."
120.	9. As to condition: of these meditation subjects nine kasinas omitting the space
kasina are conditions for the immaterial states. The ten kasinas are conditions for
the kinds of direct-knowledge. Three divine abidings are conditions for the fourth
divine abiding. Each lower immaterial state is a condition for each higher one. The
base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is a condition for the
attainment of cessation. All are conditions for living in bliss, for insight, and for
the fortunate kinds of becoming. This is "as to condition."
121.	10. As to suitability to temperament: here the exposition should be understood
according to what is suitable to the temperaments. That is to say: first, the ten
kinds of foulness and mindfulness occupied with the bodv are eleven meditation
subjects suitable for one of greedy temperament. The four divine abidings and
four colour kasinas are eight suitable for one of hating temperament. Mindfulness
of breathing is the one [recollection as a] meditation subject suitable for one of
deluded temperament and for one of speculative temperament. The first six
recollections are suitable for one of faithful temperament. Mindfulness of death,
the recollection of peace, the defining of the four elements, and the perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment, are four suitable for one of intelligent temperament.
The remaining kasinas and the immaterial states are suitable for all kinds of
temperament. And anyone of the kasinas should be limited for one of speculative
temperament and measureless for one of deluded temperament. This is how the
exposition should be understood here "as to suitability to temperament."
122. All this has been stated in the form of direct opposition and complete
suitability. But there is actually no profitable development that does not suppress
greed, etc., and help faith, and so on. And this is said in the Meghiva Sutta: "[One]
should, in addition,36 develop these four things: foulness should be developed for
the purpose of abandoning greed (lust). Loving-kindness should be developed for
36.	"In addition to the five tilings" (not quoted) dealt with earlier in the sutta, namely
perfection of virtue, good| friendship, hearing suitable tilings, energy, and understanding.
37.	"'Cryptic books': the meditation-subject books dealing with the truths, the
dependent origination, etc., which are profound and associated with voidness" (Vism-
mlit 111). Cf. M-a II264, A-a commentary to AN 4:180.
`110
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
the purpose of abandoning ill will. [115] Mindfulness of breathing should be
developed for the purpose of cutting off applied thought. Perception of
impermanence should be cultivated for the purpose of eliminating the conceit, T
am'" (A IV 358). Also in the Rahula Sutta, in the passage beginning, "Develop
loving-kindness, Rahula" (M1424), seven meditation subjects are given for a single
temperament. So instead of insisting on the mere letter, the intention should be
sought in each instance.
This is the explanatory exposition of the meditation subject referred to by the
words he should apprehend...one [meditation subject] (§28).
123. Now the words and he should apprehend are illustrated as follows. After
approaching the good friend of the kind described in the explanation of the words
then approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject (§28 and §57-73), the
meditator should dedicate himself to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One, or to
a teacher, and he should ask for the meditation subject with a sincere inclination
[of the heart] and sincere resolution.
124.	Herein, he should dedicate himself to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One,
in this way: "Blessed One, I relinquish this my person to you." For without having
thus dedicated himself, when living in a remote abode he might be unable to stand
fast if a frightening object made its appearance, and he might return to a village
abode, become associated with laymen, take up improper search and come to ruin.
But when he has dedicated himself in this way no fear arises in him if a frightening
object makes its appearance; in fact onlv joy arises in him as he reflects: "Have you
not wisely already dedicated yourself to the Enlightened One?"
125.	Suppose a man had a fine piece of [Kasi cloth. He would feel grief if it were
eaten by rats or moths; but if he gave it to a bhikkhu needing robes, he would feel
only joy if he saw the bhikkhu tearing it up [to make his patched cloak]. And so it
is with this.
126.	When he dedicates himself to a teacher, he should say: "I relinquish this my
person to you, venerable sir." For one who has not dedicated his person thus
becomes unresponsive to correction, hard to speak to, and unamenable to advice,
or he goes where he likes without asking the teacher. Consequently the teacher
does not help him with either material things or the Dhamma, and he does not
train him in the cryptic books.37 Failing to get these two kinds of help, [116] he
finds no footing in the Dispensation, and he soon comes down to misconducting
himself or to the lay state. But if he has dedicated his person, he is not unresponsive
to correction, does not go about as he likes, is easy to speak to, and lives only in
dependence on the teacher. He gets the twofold help from the teacher and attains
growth, increase, and fulfilment in the Dispensation. Like the Elder Cula-
Pindapatika-Tissa's pupils.
127. Three bhikkhus came to the elder, it seems. One of them said, "Venerable sir,
I am ready to fall from a cliff the height of one hundred men, if it is said to be to
your advantage." The second said, "Venerable sir, I am ready to grind away this
bodv from the heels up without remainder on a flat stone, if it is said to be to your
advantage." The third said, "Venerable sir, I am ready to die by stopping breathing,
`111
Chapter III
Taking a Meditation Subject
if it is said to be to your advantage." Observing, "These bhikkhus are certainly
capable of progress," the elder expounded a meditation subject to them. Following
his advice, the three attained Arahantship.
This is the benefit in self-dedication. Hence it was said above "dedicating himself
to the Blessed One, the Enlightened One, or to a teacher."
128. With a sincere inclination [of the heart] and sincere resolution (§ 123): the
meditator's inclination should be sincere in the six modes beginning with non-
greed. For it is one of such sincere inclination who arrives at one of the three kinds
of enlightenment, according as it is said: "Six kinds of inclination lead to the
maturing of the enlightenment of the Bodhisattas. With the inclination to non-
greed, Bodhisattas see the fault in greed. With the inclination to non-hate,
Bodhisattas see the fault in hate. With the inclination to non-delusion, Bodhisattas
see the fault in delusion. With the inclination to renunciation, Bodhisattas see the
fault in house life. With the inclination to seclusion, Bodhisattas see the fault in
society. With the inclination to relinquishment, Bodhisattas see the fault in all kinds
of becoming and destiny (Source untraced.)" For stream-enterers, once-returners,
non-returners, those with cankers destroyed (i.e. Arahants), Paccekabuddhas, and
Fully Enlightened Ones, whether past, future or present, all arrive at the distinction
peculiar to each by means of these same six modes. That is why he should have
sincerity of inclination in these six modes.
129.	He should be whole-heartedly resolved on that. The meaning is [117] that
he should be resolved upon concentration, respect concentration, incline to
concentration, be resolved upon Nibbana, respect Nibbana, incline to Nibbana.
130.	When, with sincerity of inclination and whole-hearted resolution in this way
he asks for a meditation subject, then a teacher who has acquired the penetration
of minds can know his temperament by surveying his mental conduct; and a teacher
who has not can know it by putting such questions to him as: "What is your
temperament?" or "What states are usually present in you?" or "What do you like
bringing to mind?" or "What meditation subject does your mind favour?" When
he knows, he can expound a meditation subject suitable to that temperament. And
in doing so, he can expound it in three ways: it can be expounded to one who has
already learnt the meditation subject by having him recite it at one or two sessions;
it can be expounded to one who lives in the same place each time he comes; and to
one who wants to learn it and then go elsewhere it can be expounded in such a
manner that it is neither too brief nor too long.
131. Herein, when first he is explaining the earth kasina, there are nine aspects
that he should explain. They are the four faults of the kasina, the making of a
kasina, the method of development for one who has made it, the two kinds of sign,
the two kinds of concentration, the seven kinds of suitable and unsuitable, the ten
kinds of skill in absorption, evenness of energy and the directions for absorption.
In the case of the other meditation subjects, each should be expounded in the
way appropriate to it. All this will be made clear in the directions for development.
But when the meditation subject is being expounded in this way, the meditator
must apprehend the sign as he listens.
`ll2
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
132. Apprehend the sign means that he must connect each aspect thus: "This is the
preceding clause, this is the subsequent clause, this is its meaning, this is its
intention, this is the simile." When he listens attentively apprehending the sign in
this way his meditation subject is well apprehended. Then, and because of that, he
successfully attains distinction, but not otherwise. This clarifies the meaning of
the words "and he must apprehend."
133. At this point the clauses approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation
subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one
that suits his own temperament (§28) have been expounded in detail in all their
aspects.
The third chapter called "The Description of Taking a
Meditation Subject" in the Treatise on the Development of
Concentration in the Path of Purification composed for the
purpose of gladdening good people.
`113
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
(Pathazn-kasina-niddesa)
1. [118] Now, it was said earlier: After that he should avoid a monastery
unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is
favourable (111.28). In the first place one who finds it convenient to live with the
teacher in the same monastery can live there while he is making certain of the
meditation subject. If it is inconvenient there, he can live in another monastery—
a suitable one—a quarter or a half or even a whole league distant. In that case,
when he finds he is in doubt about, or has forgotten, some passage in the
meditation subject, then he should do the duties in the monastery in good time
and set out afterwards, going for alms on the way and arriving at the teacher's
dwelling place after his meal. He should make certain about the meditation
subject that day in the teacher's presence. Next day, after paying homage to the
teacher, he should go for alms on his way back and so he can return to his own
dwelling place without fatigue. But one who finds no convenient place within
even a league should clarify all difficulties about the meditation subject and
make quite sure it has been properly attended to. Then he can even go far away
and, avoiding a monastery unfavourable to development of concentration, live in
one that is favourable.
[The Eighteen Faults of a Monastery]
2.	Herein, one that is unfavourable has anyone of eighteen faults. These are: (1)
largeness, (2) newness, (3) dilapidatedness, (4) a nearby road, (5) a pond, (6)
[edible] leaves, (7) flowers, (8) fruits, (9) famousness, (10) a nearby city (11) nearby
timber trees, (12) nearby arable fields, (13) presence of incompatible persons, (14)
a nearby port of entry (15) nearness to the border countries, (16) nearness to the
frontier of a kingdom, (17) unsuitability (18) lack of good friends. [119] One with
any of these faults is not favourable. He should not live there. Why?
3.	2. Firstly people with varying aims collect in a large monastery. They conflict
with each other and so neglect the duties. The Enlightenment-tree terrace, etc.,
remain unswept, the water for drinking and washing is not set out. So if he
thinks, "I shall go to the alms-resort village for alms" and takes his bowl and
robe and sets out, perhaps he sees that the duties have not been done or that a
drinking-water pot is empty and so the duty has to be done by him unexpectedly.
Drinking water must be maintained. By not doing it he would commit a
`114

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
wrongdoing in the breach of a duty. But if he does it, he loses time. He arrives too
late at the village and gets nothing because the alms giving is finished. Also,
when he goes into retreat, he is distracted by the loud noises of novices and
young bhikkhus, and by acts of the Community [being carried out]. However, he
can live in a large monastery where all the duties are done and where there are
none of the other disturbances.
4.	2. In a new monastery there is much new building activity. People criticize
someone who takes no part in it. But he can live in such a monastery where the
bhikkhus say "Let the venerable one do the ascetic's duties as much as he likes.
We shall see to the building work."
5.	3. In a dilapidated monastery there is much that needs repair. People criticize
someone who does not see about the repairing of at least his own lodging.
When he sees to the repairs, his meditation subject suffers.
r '
T
6.	4. In a monastery with a nearby road, by a main street, visitors keep arriving
night and day He has to give up his own lodging to those who come late, and he
has to go and live at the root of a tree or on top of a rock. And next dav it is the
same. So there is no opportunity [to practice] his meditation subject. But he can
live in one where there is no such disturbance by visitors.
7.	5. A pond is a rock pool. Numbers of people come there for drinking water.
Pupils of city-dwelling elders supported by the royal family come to do dyeing
work. When they ask for vessels, wood, tubs, etc., [120] they must be shown
where these things are. So he is kept all the time on the alert.
8.	6. If he goes with his meditation subject to sit by day where there are many
sorts of edible leai'es, then women vegetable-gatherers, singing as they pick leaves
nearby endanger his meditation subject by disturbing it with sounds of the
opposite sex.
7. And where there are many sorts of flowering shrubs in bloom there is the same
danger too.
9.	8. Where there are many sorts of fruits such as mangoes, rose-apples and
jak-fruits, people who want fruits come and ask for them, and they get angry if
he does not give them any, or they take them by force. When walking in the
monastery in the evening he sees them and asks, "Why do you do so, lay
followers?" they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him.
10.	9. When he lives in a monastery that is famous and renowned in the world,
like Dakkhinagiri1 Hatthikucchi, Cetiyagiri or Cittalapabbata, there are always
people coming who want to pay homage to him, supposing that he is an Arahant,
which inconveniences him. But if it suits him, he can live there at night and go
elsewhere by day.
11.	10. In one with a nearby city objects of the opposite sex come into focus.
Women-pot carriers go by bumping into him with their jars and giving no room
1. "They say it is the Dakkhinagiri in the Magadha country" (Vism-mht 116). There
is mention of a Dakkhinagiri-vihara at M-a II 293 and elsewhere.

to pass. Also important people spread out carpets in the middle of the monastery
and sit down.
12.	11. One with nearby timber trees where there are timber trees and osiers
useful for making framework is inconvenient because of the wood-gatherers
there, like the gatherers of branches and fruits already mentioned. If there are
trees in a monastery people come and cut them down to build houses with.
When he has come out of his meditation room in the evening and is walking up
and down in the monastery if he sees them and asks, "Why do you do so, lay
followers?" they abuse him as they please and even try to evict him.
13.	12. People make use of one with nearby arable fields, quite surrounded by
fields. They make a threshing floor in the middle of the monastery itself. They
thresh corn there, dry it in the forecourts,2 and cause great inconvenience. And
where there is extensive property belonging to the Community, the monastery
attendants impound cattle belonging to families and deny the water supply [to
their crops]. [121] Then people bring an ear of paddy and show it to the
Community saying "Look at your monastery attendants' work." For one reason
or another he has to go to the portals of the king or the king's ministers. This
[matter of property belonging to the Community] is included by [a monastery
that is] near arable fields.
14.	23. Presence of incompatible persons: where there are bhikkhus living who
are incompatible and mutually hostile, when they clash and it is protested,
"Venerable sirs, do not do so," they exclaim, "We no longer count now that this
refuse-rag wearer has come."
15.	14. One with a nearby water port of entry or land port of entry3 is| made
inconvenient by people constantly arriving respectively by ship or bv caravan
and crowding round, asking for space or for drinking water or salt.
16.	25. In the case of one near the border countries, people have no trust in the
Buddha, etc., there.
16. In one near the frontier of a kingdom there is fear of kings. For perhaps one
king attacks that place, thinking, "It does not submit to my rule," and the other
o......—	r -----*	------------------------ -----/ ---------------
does likewise, thinking, "It does not submit to my rule." A bhikkhu lives there
when it is conquered by one king and when it is conquered by the other. Then
they suspect him of spying, and they bring about his undoing.
17. 17. Unsuitability is that due to the risk of encountering visible data, etc., of
the opposite sex as objects or to haunting by non-human beings. Here is a story.
An elder lived in a forest, it seems. Then an ogress stood in the door of his leaf
hut and sang. The elder came out and stood in the door. She went to the end of
the walk and sang. The elder went to the end of the walk. She stood in a chasm
a hundred fathoms deep and sang. The elder recoiled. Then she suddenly

grabbed him saying, "Venerable sir, it is not just one or two of the likes of you I
have eaten."
18. 18. Lack of good friends: where it is not possible to find a good friend as a
teacher or the equivalent of a teacher or a preceptor or the equivalent of a preceptor,
the| lack of good friends there is a serious fault.
One that has any of those eighteen faults should be understood as
unfavourable. And this is said in the commentaries:
A large abode, a new abode,
One tumbling down, one near a road,
One with a pond, or leaves, or flowers,
Or fruits, or one that people seek; [122]
In cities, among timber, fields,
'	n ™' —-----f
Where people quarrel, in a port,
In border lands, on frontiers,
Unsuitableness, and no good friend—
These are the eighteen instances
A wise man needs to recognize
And give them full as wide a berth
As any footpad-hunted road.
[The Five Factors of the Resting Place]
19. One that has the five factors beginning with "not too far from and not too
near to" the alms resort is called favourable. For this is said bv the Blessed One:
"And how has a lodging five factors, bhikkhus? Here, bhikkhus, (1) a lodging is
not too far, not too near, and has a path for going and coming. (2) It is little
frequented by day with little sound and few voices by night. (3) There is little
contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning [sun] and creeping things. (4) One
who lives in that lodging easily obtains robes, alms food, lodging, and the
requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. (5) In that lodging there are elder
bhikkhus living who are learned, versed in the scriptures, observers of the
Dhamma, observers of the Vinaya, observers of the Codes, and when from time
to time one asks them questions, 'How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning
of this?' then those venerable ones reveal the unrevealed, explain the unexplained,
and remove doubt about the many things that raise doubts. This, bhikkhus, is
how a lodging has five factors"(A V 15).
These are the details for the clause, "After that he should avoid a monastery
unfavourable to the development of concentration and go to live in one that is
favourable" (111.28).
[The Lesser Impediments]
20. Then he should seiner the lesser impediments (111.28): one| living in such a
favourable monastery should sever anv minor impediments that he may still
have, that is to say long head hair, nails, and body hair should be cut, mending
and patching of old robes should be done, or those that are soiled should be
`117
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
dyed. If there is a stain on the bowl, the bowl should be baked. The bed, chair,
etc., should be cleaned up. These are the details for the clause, "Then he should
sever the lesser impediments."
[Detailed Instructions for Development]
21. Now, with the clause, And not overlook any of the directions for development
(III.28), the time has come for the detailed exposition of all meditation subjects,
starting with the earth kasina.
[The Earth Kasina]
[123] When a bhikkhu has thus severed the lesser impediments, then, on his
return from his alms round after his meal and after he has got rid of drowsiness
due to the meal, he should sit down comfortably in a secluded place and
apprehend the sign in earth that is either made up or not made up.
22. For this is said:4 "One who is learning the earth kasina apprehends the
sign in earth that is either made up or not made up; that is bounded, not
unbounded; limited, not unlimited; with a periphery, not without a periphery;
circumscribed, not uncircumscribed; either the size of a bushel (stippa) or the
size of a saucer (sarava). He sees to it that that sign is well apprehended, well
attended to, well defined. Having done that, and seeing its advantages and
perceiving it as a treasure, building up respect for it, making it dear to him, he
anchors his mind to that object, thinking, 'Surely in this way I shall be freed from
aging and death.' Secluded from sense desires ... he enters upon and dwells in
the first jhana ..."
4. "Said in the Old Commentary. 'One who is learning the earth kasina': one who is
apprehending, grasping, an earth kasina as a 'learning sign'. The meaning is, one who
is producing an earth kasina that has become the sign of learning; and here 'arousing'
should be regarded as the establishing of the sign in that way 'In earth': in an earth
disk of the kind about to be described. 'Apprehends the sign': he apprehends in that,
with knowledge connected with meditative development, the sign of earth of the kind
about to be described, as one does with the eye the sign of the face in a looking-glass.
'Made up': prepared in the manner about to be described. 'Not made up': in a disk of
earth consisting of an ordinary threshing-floor disk, and so on. 'Bounded': only in one
that has bounds. As regard the words 'the size of a bushel', etc., it would be desirable
that a bushel and a saucer were of equal size, but some say that 'the size of a saucer' is
a span and four fingers, and the 'the size of a bushel' is larger than that. 'He sees to it that
that sign is well apprehended': that meditator makes that disk of earth a well-apprehended
sign. When, after apprehending the sign in it by opening the eyes, and looking and
then closing them again, it appears to him as he adverts to it just as it did at the
moment of looking with open eyes, then he has made it well apprehended. Having
thoroughly established his mindfulness there, observing it again and again with his
mind not straying outside, he sees that it is 'well attended to'. When it is well attended
to thus by adverting and attending again and again by producing much repetition and
development instigated by that, he sees that it is 'well defined'. 'To that object': to that
object called earth kasina, which has appeared rightly owing to its having been well
apprehended. 'He anchors his mind': by bringing his own mind to access j|hana he
anchors it, keeps it from other objects" (Vism-mht 119).
`118
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
23.	Herein, when in a previous becoming a man has gone forth into
homelessness in the Dispensation or [outside it] with the risliis' going forth and
has already produced the jhana tetrad or pentad on th|e earth kasina, and so has
such merit and the support [of past practice of jhana] as well, then the sign
arises in him on earth that is not made up, that is to say on a ploughed area or on
a threshing floor, as in the Elder Mallaka's case.
It seems that while that venerable one was looking at a ploughed area the sign
arose in him the size of that area. He extended it and attained the jhana pentad.
Then by establishing insight with the jhana as the basis for it, he reached
Arahantship.
[Making an Earth Kasina]
24.	But when a man has had no such previous practice, he should make a
kasina, guarding against the four faults of a kasina and not overlooking anv of
the directions for the meditation subject learnt from the teacher. Now, the four
faults of the earth kasina are due to the intrusion of blue, yellow, red or white. So
instead of using clay of such colours, he should make the kasina of clay like that
in the stream of the Ganga,5 which is the colour of the dawn. [124] And he
should make it not in the middle of the monastery in a place where novices, etc.,
are about but on the confines of the monastery in a screened place, either [under
an overhanging rock or in a leaf hut. He can make it either portable or as a
fixture.
25. Of these, a portable one should be made by tying rags of leather or matting
onto four sticks and smearing thereon a disk of the size already mentioned,
using clay picked clean of grass, roots, gravel, and sand, and well kneaded. At
the time of the preliminary work it should be laid on the ground and looked at.
A fixture should be made by knocking stakes into the ground in the form of a
lotus calyx, lacing them over with creepers. If the clay is insufficient, then other
clay should be put underneath and a disk a span and four fingers across made
on top of that with the quite pure dawn-coloured clay. For it was with reference
onlv to measurement that it was said above either the size of a bushel or the size of a
saucer (§22). But that is bounded, not unbounded was said to show its delimitedness.
26. So, having thus made it delimited and of the size prescribed, he should
scrape it down with a stone trowel—a wooden trowel turns it a bad colour, so
that should not be employed—and make it as even as the surface of a drum.
Then he should sweep the place out and have a bath. On his return he should
seat himself on a well-covered chair with legs a span and four fingers high,
prepared in a place that is two and a half cubits [that is, two and a half times
elbow to finger-tip] from the kasina disk. For the kasina does not appear plainly
to him if he sits further off than that; and if he sits nearer than that, faults in the

Sri Lanka's principal river. However, in the Island of Sri Lanka there is a river, it seems,
called the Ravanaganga. The clay in the places where the banks are cu|t away by its
stream is the colour of dawn" (Vism-mht 119).
`119

The Earth Kasina
kasina appear. If he sits higher up, he has to look at it with his neck bent; and if
he sits lower down, his knees ache.
[Starting Contemplation]
27. So, after seating himself in the way stated, he should review the dangers in
sense desires in the way beginning, "Sense desires give little enjoyment" (M I
91) and arouse longing for the escape from sense desires, for the renunciation
that is the means to the surmounting of all suffering. He should next arouse joy
of hap|piness by recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma,
and the Sanglia; then awe by thinking, "Now, this is the way of renunciation
entered upon by all Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas and noble disciples"; and then
eagerness by thinking, "In this way I shall surely come to know the taste of the
bliss of seclusion." [125] After that he should open his eves moderately, apprehend
the sign, and so proceed to develop it.6
28.	If he opens his eyes too wide, they get fatigued and the disk becomes too
obvious, which prevents the sign becoming apparent to him. If he opens them
too little, the disk is not obvious enough, and his mind becomes drowsy which
also prevents the sign becoming apparent to him. So he should develop it by
apprehending the sign (nimitta), keeping his eyes open moderately, as if he were
seeing the reflection of his face (mukha-nimitta) on the surface of a looking-
glass.7
29.	The colour should not be reviewed. The characteristic should not be given
attention.8 But rather, while not ignoring the colour, attention should be given
6.	Apprehend the sign': apprehend with the| mind the sign apprehended by the eye
in the earth kasina. 'And develop it': the apprehending of the sign as it occurs should be
continued intensively and constantly practiced" (Vism-mht 120).
7.	"Just as one who sees his reflection (mukha-nimitta—lit. "face-sign") on the surface
of a looking-glass does not open his eyes too widely or too little (in order to get the
effect), nor does he review the colour of the looking-glass or give attention to its
characteristic, but rather looks with moderately opened eyes and sees onlv the sign of
his face, so too this meditator looks with moderately opened eyes at the earth kasina
and is occupied only with the sign" (Vism-mht 121).
8. "The dawn colour that is there in the kasina should not be thought about, though
it cannot be denied that it is apprehended by eye-consciousness. That is why instead
of saying here, 'should not be looked at,' he says that it should not be apprehended by
reviewing. Also the earth element's characteristic of hardness, which is there, should
not be given attention because the apprehension has to be done through the channel
of seeing. And after saying, 'while not ignoring the colour' he said, 'relegating the
colour to the position of a property of the physical support,' showing that here the
concern is not with the colour, which is the channel, but rather that this colour should
be treated as an accessory of the physical support; the meaning is that the kasina
(disk) should be given attention with awareness of both the accompanying earth-
aspect and its ancillary colour-aspect, but taking the earth-aspect with its ancillary
concomitant colour as both supported equally by that physical support [the disk]. 'On
the concept as the mental datum since that is what is outstanding': the term of ordinary
usage 'earth' (patliavl) as applied to earth with its accessories, since the prominence of
`120
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
by setting the mind on the [name] concept as the most outstanding mental
datum, relegating the colour to the position of a property of its physical support.
That [conceptual state] can be called by anyone he likes among the names for
earth (pathavi) such as "earth" (pathazn), "the Great One" (main), "the Friendly
One" (tnedinl), "ground" (bhumi), "the Provider of Wealth" (vasudha), "the Bearer
of Wealth" (vasudhara), etc., whichever suits his manner of perception. Still "earth"
is also a name that is obvious, so it can be developed with the obvious one by
saying "earth, earth." It should be adverted to now with eyes open, now with
eyes shut. And he should go on developing it in this way a hundred times, a
thousand times, and even more than that, until the learning sign arises.
30. When, while he is developing it in this way, it comes into focus9 as he
adverts with his eyes shut exactly as it does with his eyes open, then the learning
sign is said to have been produced. After its production he should no longer sit
in that place;10 he should return to his own quarters and go 011 developing it
sitting there. But in order to avoid the delay of foot washing, a pair of single-
soled sandals and a walking stick are desirable. Then if the new concentration
vanishes through some unsuitable encounter, he can put his sandals on, take
his walking stick, and go back to the place to re-apprehend the sign there. When
he returns he should seat himself comfortably and develop it by reiterated reaction
to it and by striking at it with thought and applied thought.
[The Counterpart Sign]
31. As he does so, the hindrances eventually become suppressed, the
defilements subside, the mind becomes concentrated with access concentration,
and the counterpart sign arises.
The difference between the earlier learning sign and the counterpart sign is
this. I11 the learning sign any fault in the kasina is apparent. But the counterpart
sign [126] appears as if breaking out from the learning sign, and a hundred
times, a thousand times more purified, like a looking-glass disk drawn from its
case, like a mother-of-pearl dish well washed, like the moon's disk coming out
from behind a cloud, like cranes against a thunder cloud. But it has neither
colour nor shape; for if it had, it would be cognizable by the eye, gross, susceptible
of comprehension [by insight—(see XX.2f.)] and stamped with the three
characteristics.11 But it is not like that. For it is born onlv of perception in one
who has obtained concentration, being a mere mode of appearance.12 But as
its individual effect is due to outstandingness of the earth element: 'setting the mind'
on that mental datum consisting of a [name-] concept (pannatti-dliamma), the kasina
should be given attention as 'earth, earth.'—If the mind is to be set on a mere concept
by means of a term of common usage,| ought earth to be given attention by means of
different names?—It can be. What is wrong? It is to show that that is done he said,
'MahT, medini/ and so on" (Vism-mht 122).
9.	"'Comes into focus: becomes the resort of mind-door impulsion" (Vism-mht 122).
10.	"Why should he not? If, after the learning sign was produced, he went on
developing it by looking at the disk of the earth, there would be no arising of the
counterpart sign" (Vism-mht 122).
`121
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
soon as it arises the hindrances are quite suppressed, the defilements subside,
and the mind becomes concentrated in access concentration.
[The Two Kinds of Concentration]
32.	Now, concentration is of two kinds, that is to say, access concentration and
absorption concentration: the mind becomes concentrated in two ways, that is,
on the plane of access and on the plane of obtainment. Herein, the mind becomes
concentrated on the plane of access by the abandonment of the hindrances, and
on the plane of obtainment by the manifestation of the jhana factors.
33.	The difference between the two kinds of concentration is this. The factors
are not strong in access. It is because they are not strong that when access has
arisen, the mind now makes the sign its object and now re-enters the life-
continuum,13 just as when a young child is lifted up and stood on its feet, it
--
11.	"Stamped with the three characteristics of the formed beginning with rise (see A
1152), or marked with the three characteristics beginning with impermanence" (Vism-
mht 122).
12.	"If 'it is not like that'—is not possessed of colour, etc.—then how is it the object
of jhana? It is in order to answer that question that the sentence beginning, 'For it is ...'
is given. 'Born of the perception': produced by the perception during development,
simply born from the perception during development. Since there is no arising from
anywhere of what has no individual essence, he therefore said, 'Being the mere mode
of appearance'" (Vism-mht 122). See Ch. VIII, n. 11.
13.	Bhavariga (life-continuum, lit. "constituent of becoming") and javana (impulsion)
are first mentioned in this work at 1.57 (see n. 16); this is the second mention. The
"cognitive series" (citta-vlthi) so extensively used here is unknown as such in the
Pitakas. Perhaps the seed from which it sprang may exist in, say, such passages as:
"Due to eye and to visible data eye-consciousness arises. The coincidence of the three
is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What he feels he perceives. What
he perceives he thinks about4. What he thinks about he diversifies [by means of
craving, pride and false view]... Due to mind and to mental data ..." (M1111). And: "Is
the eye permanent or impermanent... Are visible objects permanent or impermanent?
7 I	I	J-1	I	-------
... Is the mind permanent or impermanent? Are mental data ... Is mind-consciousness
... Is mind-contact... Is any feeling, any perception, any formation, any consciousness,
that arises with mind-contact as condition permanent or impermanent?" (M III 279).
And: "These five faculties [of eye, etc.] each with its separate objective field and no one
of them experiencing as its objective field the province of any other, have mind as their
refuge, and mind experiences their provinces as its objective field" (M I 295). This
treatment of consciousness implies, as it were, more than even a "double thickness"
of consciousness. An already-formed nucleus of the cognitive series, based on such
Sutta Pitakas material, appears in the Abhidhamma Pitakas. The following two
quotations show how the commentary (bracketed italics) expands the Abhidhamma
Pitakas treatment.
(i) "Herein, what is eve-consciousness element? Due to eye and to visible data (as
support condition, and to functional mind element (= 5-door adverting), as disappearance
condition, and to the remaining three immaterial aggregates as conascence condition) there
arises consciousness ... which is eye-consciou|sness element. [Similarly with the other
four sense elements.] Herein, what is mind element? Eye-consciousness having arisen

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
repeatedly falls down on the ground. But the factors are strong in absorption. It
is because they are strong that when absorption concentration has arisen, the
mind, having once interrupted the flow of the life-continuum, carries on with a
stream of profitable impulsion for a whole night and for a whole day, just as a
healthv man, after rising from his seat, could stand for a whole day.
[Guarding the Sign]
34. The arousing of the counterpart sign, which arises together with access
concentration, is very difficult. Therefore if he is able to arrive at absorption
in that same session bv extending the sign, it is good. If not, then he must
guard the sign diligently as if it were the foetus of a Wheel-turning Monarch
(World-ruler).
--
and ceased, next to that there arises consciousness ... which is appropriate (profitable
or unprofitable) mind element (in the mode of receiving). [Similarly with the other
four sense elements.] Or else it is the first reaction to any mental datum (to be taken
as functional mind element in the mode of mind-door adverting). Herein, what is
mind-consciousness element? Eye-consciousness having arisen and ceased, next to
that there arises mind element. (Resultant) mind element having arisen and ceased,
also (next to that there arises resultant mind-consciousness element in the mode of
investigating; and that having arisen and ceased, next to that there arises functional
mind-consciousness element in the mode of determining; and that having arisen and
ceased) next to that there arises consciousness ... which is appropriate mind-
consciousness element (in the mode of impulsion). [Similarly with the other four
sense elements.] Due to (life-continuum) mind and to mental data there arises
consciousness ... which is appropriate (impulsion) mind-consciousness element
(following on the above-mentioned mind-door adverting)" (Vibh 87-90 and Vibh-a
81 f.).
(ii) "Eye-consciousness and its associated states are a condition, as proximity
condition, for (resultant) mind element and for its associated states. Mind element and
its associated states are a condition, as proximity condition, for (root-causeless resultant)
---------------^-------------------------,-------------------------------------------- ... ...... ,
mind-consciousness element (in the mode of investigating) and for its associated states.
(Next to that, the mind-consciousness elements severally in the modes of determining,
impulsion, registration, and life-continuum should be mentioned, though they are not, since
the teaching is abbreviated.) [Similarly for the other four senses and mind-consciousness
element]. Preceding profitable (impulsion) states are a condition, as proximity condition,
for subsequent indeterminate (registration, life-continuum) states [etc.]" (Patth II, and
Corny, 33-34).
The form that the two kinds (5-door and mind-door) of the cognitive series take is
shown in Table V The following are some Pitakas references for the individual modes:
bhavanga (life-continuum): Patth I 159, 160, 169, 324; avajjana (adverting) Patth I 159,
160, 169, 324; sampaticchana (receiving), santlrana (investigating), votthapana
(determining), and tadarammaria (registration) appear onlv in the Commentaries. Javana
(impulsion): Patis II 73, 76. The following references may also be noted here: anuloma

So guard the sign, nor count the cost,
And what is gained will not be lost;
Who fails to have this guard maintained
Will lose each time what he has gained. [127]
35. Herein, the way of guarding it is this:
(1) Abode, (2) resort, (3) and speech, (4) and person,
(5) The food, (6) the climate, (7) and the posture—
Eschew these seven different kinds
Whenever found unsuitable.
But cultivate the suitable;
For one perchance so doing finds
He need not wait too long until
Absorption shall his wish fulfil.
36.	1. Herein, an abode is unsuitable if, while he lives in it, the unarisen sign
does not arise in him or is lost when it arises, and where unestablished
mindfulness fails to become established and the unconcentrated mind fails to
become concentrated. That is suitable in which the sign arises and becomes
confirmed, in which mindfulness becomes established and the mind becomes
concentrated, as in the Elder Padhaniya-Tissa, resident at Nagapabbata. So if a
monastery has many abodes he can try them one by one, living in each for three
days, and stay on where his mind becomes unified. For it was due to suitability
of abode that five hundred bhikkhus reached Arahantship while still dwelling
in the Lesser Naga Cave (Cula-naga-lena) in Tambapanni Island (Sri Lanka) after
apprehending their meditation subject there. There is no counting the stream-
enterers who have reached Arahantship there after reaching the noble plane
elsewhere; so too in the monastery of Cittalapabbata, and others.
37.	2. An alms-resort village lying to the north or south of the lodging, not too
far, within one kosa and a half, and where alms food is easily obtained, is suitable.
The opposite kind is unsuitable.14
38.	3. Speech: that included in the thirty-two kinds of aimless talk is unsuitable;
for it leads to the disappearance of the sign. But talk based on the ten examples
of talk is suitable, though even that should be discussed with moderation.15
39. 4. Person: one not given to aimless talk, who has the special qualities of
virtue, etc., by acquaintanceship with whom the unconcentrated mind becomes
concentrated, or the concentrated mind becomes more so, is suitable. One who is
much concerned with his body,16 who is addicted to aimless talk, is unsuitable;
for he only creates disturbances, like muddy water added to clear water. And it
14.	North or south to avoid facing the rising sun in coming or going. Kosa is not in
PED; "one and a half kosa = 3,000 bows" (Vism-mht 123).
15.	Twenty-six kinds of "aimless" (lit. "animal") talk are given in the Suttjas (e.g. MII
1; III 113), which the commentary increases to thirty-two (M-a III 233). The ten instances
of talk are those given in the Suttas (e.g. M 1145; III 113). See Ch. I, n.12.
16.	"One who is occupied with exercising and caring for the body" (Vism-mht 124).
`124
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
was owing to one such as this that the attainments of the young bhikkhu who
lived at Kotapabbata vanished, not to mention the sign. [128]
40.	5. Food: Sweet food suits one, sour food another.
6. Climate: a cool climate suits one, a warm one another. So when he finds that
by using certain food or by living in a certain climate he is comfortable, or his
unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated, or his concentrated mind becomes
more so, then that food or that climate is suitable. Anv other food or climate is
unsuitable.
41.	7. Postures: walking suits one; standing or sitting or lying down suits
another. So he should try them, like the abode, for three days each, and that
posture is suitable in which his unconcentrated mind becomes concentrated or
his concentrated mind becomes more so. Any other should be understood as
unsuitable.
So he should avoid the seven unsuitable kinds and cultivate the suitable. For
when he practices in this way, assiduously cultivating the sign, then, "he need
not wait too long until absorption shall his wish fulfil."
[The Ten Kinds of Skill in Absorption]
42.	However, if this does not happen while he is practicing in this way, then he
should have recourse to the ten kinds of skill in absorption. Here is the method.
Skill in absorption needs [to be dealt with in] ten aspects: (1) making the basis
clean, (2) maintaining balanced faculties, (3) skill in the sign, (4) he exerts the
mind on an occasion when it should be exerted, (5) he restrains the mind on an
occasion when it should be restrained, (6) he encourages the mind on an
occasion when it should be encouraged, (7) he looks on at the mind with
equanimity when it should be looked on at with equanimity (8) avoidance of
unconcentrated persons, (9) cultivation of concentrated persons, (10) resoluteness
upon that (concentration).
43.	1. Herein, making the basis clean is cleansing the internal and the external
basis. For when his head hair, nails and body hair are long, or when the body is
soaked with sweat, then the internal basis is unclean and unpurified. But when
an old dirty smelly robe is worn or when the lodging is dirty, then the external
basis is unclean and unpurified. [129] When the internal and external bases are
unclean, then the knowledge in the consciousness and consciousness-
concomitants that arise is unpurified, like the light of a lamp's flame that arises
with an unpurified lamp-bowl, wick and oil as its support; formations do not
become evident to one who tries to comprehend them with unpurified knowledge,
and when he devotes himself to his meditation subject, it does not come to
growth, increase and fulfilment.
44. But when the internal and external bases are clean, then the knowledge in
the consciousness and consciousness-concomitants that arise is clean and
purified, like the light of a lamp's flame that arises with a purified lamp bowl,
wick and oil as its support; formations become evident to one who tries to
comprehend them with purified knowledge, and as he devotes himself to his
meditation subject, it comes to growth, increase and fulfilment.
`125
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
45.	2. Maintaining balanced faculties is equalizing the [five] faculties of faith and
the rest. For if his faith faculty is strong and the others weak, then the energy
faculty cannot perform its function of exerting, the mindfulness faculty its
function of establishing, the concentration faculty its function of not distracting,
and the understanding faculty its function of seeing. So in that case the faith
faculty should be modified either by reviewing the individual essences of the
states [concerned, that is, the objects of attention] or by not giving [them] attention
in the way in which the faith faculty became too strong. And this is illustrated
by the story of the Elder Vakkali (S III 119).
46.	Then if the energy faculty is too strong, the faith faculty cannot perform its
function of resolving, nor can the rest of the faculties perform their several
functions. So in that case the energy faculty should be modified by developing
tranquillity and so on. And this should be illustrated by the story of the Elder
Sona (Vin 1179-85; A III 374-76). So too with the rest; for it should be understood
that when anyone of them is too strong the others cannot perform their several
functions.
47.	However, what is particularly recommended is balancing faith with
understanding, and concentration with energy For one strong in faith and
weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly One
strong in understanding and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as
hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine. With the balancing of
the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it.
Then idleness overpowers one strong in concentration and weak in energy, since
concentration favours idleness. [130] Agitation overpowers one strong in energy
and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation. But concentration
coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness, and energy coupled with
concentration cannot lapse into agitation. So these two should be balanced; for
absorption comes with the balancing of the two.
48.	Again, [concentration and faith should be balanced]. One working on
concentration needs strong faith, since it is with such faith and confidence that
he reaches absorption. Then there is [balancing of] concentration and
understanding. One working on concentration needs strong unification, since
that is how he reaches absorption; and one working on insight needs strong
understanding, since that is how he reaches penetration of characteristics; but
with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well.
49. Strong mindfulness, however, is needed in all instances; for mindfulness
protects the mind from lapsing into agitation through faith, energy and
understanding, which favour agitation, and from lapsing into idleness through
concentration, which favours idleness. So it is as desirable in all instances as a
seasoning of salt in all sauces, as a prime minister in all the king's business.
Hence it is said [in the commentaries (D-a 788, M-a 1292, etc)]: "And mindfulness
has been called universal by the Blessed One. For what reason? Because the
mind has mindfulness as its refuge, and mindfulness is manifested as protection,
and there is no exertion and restraint of the mind without mindfulness."
`126
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
50.	3. Skill in the sign is skill in producing the as yet unproduced sign of
unification of mind through the earth kasina, etc.; and it is skill in developing
[the sign] when produced, and skill in protecting [the sign] when obtained by
development. The last is what is intended here.
51.	4. How does he exert the mind on a\n occasion when it should he exerted? When
his mind is slack with over-laxness of energy, etc., then, instead of developing
the three enlightenment factors beginning with tranquillity he should develop
those beginning with investigation-of-states. For this is said by the Blessed One:
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put wet
grass on it, put wet cow-dung on it, put wet sticks on it, sprinkled it with water,
and scattered dust on it, would that man be able to make the small fire burn up?"
[131]—"No, venerable sir."—"So too, bhikkhus, when the mind is slack, that is
not the time to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor, the concentration
enlightenment factor or the equanimity enlightenment factor. Why is that?
Because a slack mind cannot well be roused by those states. When the mind is
slack, that is the time to develop the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor,
the energy enlightenment factor and the happiness enlightenment factor. Why
is that? Because a slack mind can well be roused by those states.
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to make a small fire burn up, and he put
dry grass on it, put dry cow-dung on it, put dry sticks on it, blew on it with his
mouth, and did not scatter dust on it, would that man be able to make that small
fire burn up?"—"Yes, venerable sir" (S V 112).
52. And here the development of the investigation-of-states enlightenment
factor, etc., should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively for
this is said: "Bhikkhus, there are profitable and unprofitable states, reprehensible
and blameless states, inferior and superior states, dark and bright states the
counterpart of each other. Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment
for the arising of the unarisen investigation-of-states enlightenment factor, or
leads to the growth, fulfilment, development and perfection of the arisen
investigation-of-states enlightenment factor." Likewise: "Bhikkhus there is the
element of initiative, the element of launching, and the element of persistence.
Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the
unarisen energy enlightenment factor, or leads to the growth, fulfilment,
development and perfection of the arisen energy enlightenment factors."
Likewise: "Bhikkhus, there are states productive of the happiness enlightenment
factor. Wise attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of
the unarisen happiness enlightenment factor, or leads to the growth, fulfilment,
development and perfection of the arisen happiness enlightenment factor" (S V
104). [132]
53. Herein, wise attention given to the profitable, etc., is attention occurring in
penetration of individual essences and of [the three] general characteristics.
Wise attention given to the element of initiative, etc., is attention occurring in the
arousing of the element of initiative, and so on. Herein, initial energy is called
the element of initiative. The element of launching is stronger than that because it
launches out from idleness. The element of persistence is still stronger than that
`127
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
because it goes on persisting in successive later stages. States productive of the
happiness enlightenment factor is a name for happiness itself; and attention that
arouses that is wise attention.
54.	There are, besides, seven things that lead to the arising of the investigation-
of-states enlightenment factor: (i) asking questions, (ii) making the basis clean,
(iii) balancing the faculties, (iv) avoidance of persons without understanding,
(v) cultivation of persons with understanding, (vi) reviewing the field for the
exercise of profound knowledge, (vii) resoluteness upon that [investigation of
states].
55.	Eleven things lead to the arising of the energy enlightenment factor: (i)
reviewing the fearfulness of the states of loss such as the hell realms, etc., (ii)
seeing benefit in obtaining the mundane and supramundane distinctions
dependent on energy, (iii) reviewing the course of the journey [to be travelled]
--------------------y---,----------^-----------------.....". L............ J
thus: "The path taken by the Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and the great disciples
has to be taken by me, and it cannot be taken by an idler," (iv) being a credit to
the alms food by producing great fruit for the givers, (v) reviewing the greatness
of the Master thus: "My Master praises the energetic, and this unsurpassable
Dispensation that is so helpful to us is honoured in the practice, not otherwise,"
(vi) reviewing the greatness of the heritage thus: "It is the great heritage called
the Good Dhamma that is to be acquired by me, and it cannot be acquired by an
idler," (vii) removing stiffness and torpor by attention to perception of light,
change of postures, frequenting the open air, etc., (viii) avoidance of idle persons,
(ix) cultivation of energetic persons, (x) reviewing the right endeavours, (xi)
resoluteness upon that [energy].
56. Eleven things lead to the arising of the happiness enlightenment factor:
the recollections (i) of the Buddha, (ii) of the Dhamma, (iii) of the Sangha, (iv) of
virtue, (v) of generosity and (vi) of deities, (vii) the recollection of peace, [133]
(viii) avoidance of rough persons, (ix) cultivation of refined persons, (x) reviewing
encouraging discourses, (xi) resoluteness upon that [happiness].
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the investigation-of-
states enlightenment factor, and the others. This is how he exerts the mind on an
occasion when it should be exerted.
57. 5. How does he restrain the mind on an occasion when it should be restrained?
When his mind is agitated through over-energeticness, etc., then, instead of
developing the three enlightenment factors beginning with investigation-of-
states, he should develop those beginning with tranquillity; for this is said by
the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass
of fire, and he put dry grass on it ... and did not scatter dust on it, would that
man be able to extinguish that great mass of fire?"—"No, venerable sir."—"So
too, bhikkhus, when the mind is agitated, that is not the time to develop the
investigation-of-states enlightenment factor, the energy enlightenment factor or
the happiness enlightenment factor. Why is that? Because an agitated mind
cannot well be quieted by those states. When the mind is agitated, that is th|e time
to develop the tranquillity enlightenment factor, the concentration enlightenment
`128
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
factor and the equanimity enlightenment factor. Why is that? Because an agitated
mind can well be quieted by those states."
"Bhikkhus, suppose a man wanted to extinguish a great mass of fire,
and he put wet grass on it ... and scattered dust on it, would that man be
able to extinguish that great mass of fire?"—"Yes, venerable sir" (S V 114).
58. And here the development of the tranquillity enlightenment factor, etc.,
should be understood as the nutriment for each one respectively for this is said:
"Bhikkhus, there is bodily tranquillity and mental tranquillity. [134] Wise
attention much practiced therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen
tranquillity enlightenment factor, or leads to the growth, fulfilment, development
and perfection of the arisen tranquillity enlightenment factor." Likewise:
"Bhikkhus, there is the sign of serenity, the sign of non-diversion. Wise attention,
much practiced, therein is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen
concentration enlightenment factor, or it leads to the growth, fulfilment,
development and perfection of the arisen concentration enlightenment factor."
Likewise: "Bhikkhus, there are states productive of the equanimity enlightenment
factor. Wise attention, much practiced, therein is the nutriment for the arising of
the unarisen equanimity enlightenment factor, or it leads to the growth, fulfilment,
development and perfection of the arisen equanimity enlightenment factor" (S
V 104).
59.	Herein wise attention given to the three instances is attention occurring in
arousing tranquillity, etc., by observing the way in which they arose in him
earlier. The sign of serenity is a term for serenity itself, and non-diversion is a term
for that too in the sense of non-distraction.
60.	There are, besides, seven things that lead to the arising of the tranquillity
enlightenment factor: (i) using superior food, (ii) living in a good climate, (iii)
maintaining a pleasant posture, (iv) keeping to the mid|dle, (v) avoidance of
violent persons, (vi) cultivation of persons tranquil in body, (vii) resoluteness
upon that [tranquillity].
61.	Eleven things lead to the arising of the concentration enlightenment factor:
(i) making the basis clean, (ii) skill in the sign, (iii) balancing the faculties, (iv)
restraining the mind on occasion, (v) exerting the mind on occasion, (vi)
encouraging the listless mind by means of faith and a sense of urgency, (vii)
looking on with equanimity at what is occurring rightly, (viii) avoidance of
unconcentrated persons, (ix) cultivation of concentrated persons, (x) reviewing
of the jhanas and liberations, (xi) resoluteness upon that [concentration].
62. Five things lead to the arising of the equanimity enlightenment factor: (i)
maintenance of neutrality towards living beings; (ii) maintenance of neutrality
towards formations (inanimate things); (iii) avoidance of persons who show
favouritism towards beings and formations; (iv) cultivation of persons who
maintain neutrality towards beings and formations; (v) resoluteness upon that
[equanimity]. [135]
So by arousing these things in these ways he develops the tranquillity
enlightenment factor, as well as the others. This is how he restrains the mind on
an occasion when it should be restrained.
`129
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
63.	6. How does he encourage the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged?
When his mind is listless owing to sluggishness in the exercise of understanding
or to failure to attain the bliss of peace, then he should stimulate it by reviewing
the eight grounds for a sense of urgency These are the four, namely, birth, aging,
sickness, and death, with the suffering of the states of loss as the fifth, and also
the suffering in the past rooted in the round [of rebirths], the suffering in the
future rooted in the round [of rebirths], and the suffering in the present rooted in
the search for nutriment. And he creates confidence bv recollecting the special
qualities of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. This is how he encourages
the mind on an occasion when it should be encouraged.
64.	7. How does he look on at the minei| with equanimity on an occasion when it
should be looked on at with equanimity? When he is practicing in this wav and his
mind follows the road of serenity occurs evenly on the object, and is unidle,
unagitated and not listless, then he is not interested to exert or restrain or
encourage it; he is like a charioteer when the horses are progressing evenly. This
is how he looks on at the mind with equanimity on an occasion when it should
be looked on at with equanimity.
65.	8. Avoidance of unconcentrated persons is keeping far away from persons who
have never trodden the way of renunciation, who are busy with many affairs,
and whose hearts are distracted.
9.	Cultivation of concentrated persons is approaching periodically persons who
have trodden the way of renunciation and obtained concentration.
10.	Resoluteness upon that is the state of being resolute upon concentration; the
meaning is, giving concentration importance, tending, leaning and inclining to
concentration.
This is how the tenfold skill in concentration should be undertaken.
66.	Anv man who acquires this sign,
This tenfold skill will need to heed
In order for absorption to gain
Thus achieving his bolder goal.
But if in spite of his efforts
No result comes that might requite
His work, still a wise wight persists,
Never this task relinquishing, [136]
Since a tiro, if he gives up,
Thinking not to continue in
The task, never gains distinction
Here no matter how small at all.
A man wise in temperament17
Notices how his mind inclines:
Energy and serenity
Always he couples each to each.
17. Buddha—"possessed of wit": not in PED; see M-a I 39.

Now, his mind, seeing that it holds back,
He prods, now the restraining rein
Tightening, seeing it pull too hard;
Guiding with even pace the race.
Well-controlled bees get the pollen;
Well-balanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves, thread, and ships, and oil-tubes too,
Gain thus, not otherwise, the prize.
Let him set aside this lax
Also this agitated state,
Steering here his mind at the sign
As the bee and the rest suggest.
[The Five Similes]
67.	Here is the explanation of the meaning.
When a too clever bee learns that a flower on a tree is blooming, it sets out
hurriedly overshoots the mark, turns back, and arrives when the pollen is finished;
and another, not clever enough bee, who sets out with too slow a speed, arrives
when the pollen is finished too; but a clever bee sets out with balanced speed,
arrives with ease at the cluster of flowers, takes as much pollen as it pleases and
enjoys the honey-dew.
68.	Again, when a surgeon's pupils are being trained in the use of the scalpel
on a lotus leaf in a dish of water, one who is too clever applies the scalpel
hurriedly and either cuts the lotus leaf in two or pushes it under the water, and
another who is not clever enough does not even dare to touch it with the scalpel
for fear of cutting it in two or pushing it under; but one who is clever shows the
scalpel stroke on it by means of a balanced effort, and being good at his craft he
is rewarded on such occasions.
69.	Again when the king announces, "Anyone who can draw out a spider's
thread four fathoms long shall receive four thousand," one man who is too
clever breaks the spider's thread here and there bv pulling it hurriedly, and
another who is not clever enough does not dare to touch it with his hand for fear
of breaking it, but a clever man pulls it out starting from the end with a balanced
effort, winds it on a stick, and so wins the prize.
70.	Again, a too clever [137] skipper hoists full sails in a high wind and sends his
ship adrift, and another, not clever enough skipper, lowers his sails in a light wind
and remains where he is, but a clever skipper hoists full sails in a light wind, takes
in half his sails in a high wind, and so arrives safely at his desired destination.
71.	Again, when a teacher says, "Anyone who fills the oil-tube without spilling
any oil will win a prize," one who is too clever fills it hurriedly out of greed for
the prize, and he spills the oil, and another who is not clever enough does not
dare to pour the oil at all for fear of spilling it, but one who is clever fills it with
a balanced effort and wins the prize.
72.	Just as in these five similes, so too when the sign arises, one bhikkhu forces
his energy, thinking "I shall soon reach absorption." Then his mind lapses into
`131
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
agitation because of his mind's over-exerted energy and he is prevented from
reaching absorption. Another who sees the defect in over-exertion slacks off his
energy, thinking, "What is absorption to me now?" Then his mind lapses into
idleness because of his mind's too lax energy and he too is prevented from
reaching absorption. Yet another who frees his mind from idleness even when it
is only slightly idle and from agitation when only slightly agitated, confronting the
sign with balanced effort, reaches absorption. One should be like the last-named.
73. It was with reference to this meaning that it was| said above:
"Well-controlled bees get the pollen;
Well-balanced efforts meet to treat
Leaves, thread, and ships, and oil-tubes too,
Gain thus, not otherwise, the prize.
Let him set aside then this lax
Also this agitated state,
Steering here his mind at the sign
As the bee and the rest suggest".
[Absorption in the Cognitive Series]
74. So, while he is guiding his mind in this way confronting the sign, [then
knowing]: "Now absorption will succeed," there arises in him mind-door
adverting with that same earth kasina as its object, interrupting the [occurrence
of consciousness as] life-continuum, and evoked by the constant repeating of
"earth, earth." After that, either four or five impulsions impel on that same object,
the last one of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere. The rest are of
the sense sphere, but they have stronger applied thought, sustained thought,
happiness, bliss, and unification of mind than the normal ones. They are called
"preliminary work" [consciousnesses] because they are the preliminary work
for absorption; [138] and they are also called "access" [consciousnesses] because
of their nearness to absorption because they happen in its neighbourhood, just
as the words "village access" and "city access" are used for a place near to a
village, etc.; and they are also called "conformity" [consciousnesses] because
they conform to those that precede the "preliminary work" [consciousnesses]
and to the absorption that follows. And the last of these is also called "change-
of-lineage" because it transcends the limited [sense-sphere] lineage and brings
into being the exalted [fine-material-sphere] lineage.18
18. "It guards the line (gain tayati), thus it is lineage {gotta). When it occurs limitedly
it guards the naming (abhidliana) and the recognition (bnddhi) of the naming as restricted
to a definite scope (ekamsa-visayata). For just as recognition does not take place without
a meaning (attlia) for its objective support (aramniana), so naming (abhidliana) does not
take place without what is named (abhidheyya). So it (the gotta) is said to protect and
keep these. But the limited should be regarded as the materiality peculiar to sense-
sphere states, which are the resort of craving for sense desires, and destitute of the
exalted (fine-material and immaterial) or the unsurpassed (supramundane). The exalted
lineage is explainable in the same way" (Vism-mht 134).
`132
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
75.	But omitting repetitions,19 then either the first is the "preliminary work,"
the second "access," the third "conformity" and the fourth, "cliange-of-lineage,"
or else the first is "access," the second "conformity," and the third "change-of-
lineage." Then either the fourth [in the latter case] or the fifth [in the former case]
is the absorption consciousness. For it is only either the fourth or the fifth that
fixes in absorption. And that is according as there is swift or sluggish direct-
knowledge. (cf. XXI. 117) Beyond that, impulsion lapses and the life-continuum20
takes over.
76.	But the Abhidhamma scholar, the Elder Godatta, quoted this text: "Preceding
profitable states are a condition, as repetition condition, for succeeding profitable
states" (Patth I 5). Adding, "It is owing to the repetition condition that each
succeeding state is strong, so there is absorption also in the sixth and seventh."
77.	That is rejected by the commentaries with the remark that it is merely that
elder's opinion, adding that, "It is only either in the fourth or the fifth21 that there
is absorption. Beyond that, impulsion lapses. It is said to do so because of
nearness of the life-continuum." And that has been stated in this way after
consideration, so it cannot be rejected. For just as a man who is running towards
a precipice and wants to stop cannot do so when he has his foot on the edge but
falls over it, so there can be no fixing in absorption in the sixth or the seventh
because of the nearness to the life-continuum. That is why it should be understood
that there is absorption only in the fourth or the fifth.
19.	See XVII. 189 and note.
20.	"The intention is that it is as if the sixth and seventh impulsions had lapsed since
impulsion beyond the fifth is exhausted. The elder's opinion was that just as the first
impulsion, which lacks the quality of repetition, does not arouse change-of-lineage
because of its weakness, while the second or the third, which have the quality of
repetition, can do so because they are strong on that account, so too the sixth and
seventh fix in absorption owing to their strength due to their quality of repetition.
But it is unsupported by a sutta or by any teacher's statement in conformity with
a sutta. And the text quoted is not a reason because strength due to the quality of
repetition is not a principle without exceptions (anekantikatta); for the first volition,
which is not a repetition, has result experienceable here and now, while the second
to the sixth, which are repetitions, have result experienceable in future becomings"
(Vism-mht 135).
21. Either in the fourth or the fifthetc., is said for the purpose of concluding [the
discussion] with a paragraph showing the correctness of the meaning already stated.—
Herein, if the sixth and seventh impulsions are said to have lapsed because impulsion
is exhausted, how does seventh-impulsion volition come to have result experienceable
in the next rebirth and to be of immediate effect on rebirth?—This is not owing to
strength got through a repetition condition.—What then?—It is owing to the difference
in the function's position (kiriyavattha). For the function [of impulsion] has three
positions, that is, initial, medial and final. Herein, experienceability of result in the next
rebirth and immediateness of effect on rebirth are due to the last volition's final
position, not to its strength ... So the fact that the sixth and seventh lapse because
impulsion is used up cannot be objected to" (Vism-mht 135). See Table V
`133
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
78. But that absorption is only of a single conscious moment. For there are
seven instances in which the normal extent22 [of the cognitive series] does not
apply. They are in the cases of the first absorption, the mundane kinds of direct-
knowledge, the four paths, fruition next after the path, life-continuum jhana in
the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming, the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception as condition for cessation [of perception and
feeling], and the fruition attainment in one emerging from cessation. Here the
fruition next after the path does not exceed three [consciousnesses in number];
[139] the [consciousnesses] of the base consisting of neither perception nor non-
perception as condition for cessation do not exceed two [in number]; there is no
measure of the [number of consciousne|sses in the] life-continuum in the fine-
material and immaterial [kinds of becoming]. In the remaining instances [the
number of consciousnesses is] one only. So absorption is of a single
consciousness moment. After that, it lapses into the life-continuum. Then the
life-continuum is interrupted by adverting for the purpose of reviewing the
jhana, next to which comes the reviewing of the jhana.
[The First Jhana]
79.	At this point, "Quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from
unprofitable things he enters upon and dwells in the first jhana, which is
accompanied by applied and sustained thought with happiness and bliss born
of seclusion" (Vibh 245), and so he has attained the first jhana, which abandons
five factors, possesses five factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten
characteristics, and is of the earth kasina.
80.	Herein, quite secluded from sense desires means having secluded himself
from, having become without, having gone away from, sense desires. Now, this
word quite (eva) should be understood to have the meaning of absoluteness.
Precisely because it has the meaning of absoluteness it shows how, on the actual
occasion of entering upon and dwelling in the first jhana, sense desires as well
as being non-existent then are the first jhana's contrary opposite, and it also
shows that the arrival takes place only (eva) through the letting go of sense
desires. How?
81.	When absoluteness is introduced thus, "quite secluded from sense desires,"
what is expressed is this: sense desires are certainly incompatible with this
jhana; when they exist, it does not occur, just as when there is darkness, there is
no lamplight; and it is only by letting go of them that it is reached, just as the
further bank is reached only by letting go of the near bank. That is why
absoluteness is introduced.
82.	Here it might be asked: But why is this [word "quite"] mentioned only in
the first phrase and not in the second? How is this, might he enter upon and
22. '"The normal extent does not apply' here 'in the seven instances' because of the
immeasurability of the conscious moment in some, and the extreme brevity of the
moment in others; for 'extent' is inapplicable here in the sense of complete cognitive
series, which is why 'in fruition next to the path,' etc., is said" (Vism mht 136).
`134
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
dwell in the first jhana even when not secluded from unprofitable things?—It
should not be regarded in that way. It is mentioned in the first phrase as the
escape from them; for this jhana is the escape from sense desires since it surmounts
the sense-desire element and since it is incompatible with greed for sense desires,
according as it is said: "The escape from sense desires is this, that is to say,
renunciation" (D III 275). But in the second phrase [140] the word eva should be
adduced and taken as said, as in the passage, "Bhikkhus, onlv (eva) here is there
an ascetic, here a second ascetic" (M I 63). For it is impossible to enter upon and
dwell in jhana unsecluded also from unprofitable things, in other words, the
hindrances other than that [sense desire]. So this word must be read in both
phrases thus: "Quite secluded from sense desires, quite secluded from
unprofitable things." And although the word "secluded" as a general term
includes all kinds of seclusion, that is to say, seclusion by substitution of
opposites, etc., and bodily seclusion, etc.,23 still only the three, namely, bodily
seclusion, mental seclusion, and seclusion by suppression (suspension) should
be regarded here.
83. But this term "sense desires" should be regarded as including all kinds,
that is to say sense desires as object as given in the Niddesa in the passage
beginning, "What are sense desires as object? They are agreeable visible objects
..." (Nidd II), and the sense desires as defilement given there too and in the
Vibhanga thus: "Zeal as sense desire (kama), greed as sense desire, zeal and
greed as sense desire, thinking as sense desire, greed as sense desire, thinking
and greed as sense desire"24 (Nidd I 2; Vibh 256).| That being so, the words "quite
secluded from sense desires" properly mean "quite secluded from sense desires
as object," and express bodily seclusion, while the words "secluded from
unprofitable things" properly mean "secluded from sense desires as defilement
or from all unprofitable things," and express mental seclusion. And in this case
giving up of pleasure in sense desires is indicated by the first since it onlv
expresses seclusion from sense desires as object, while acquisition of pleasure
23. The five (see e.g. Patis II 220; M-a I 85) are suppression (by concentration),
substitution of opposites (by insight), cutting off (by the path), tranquillization (by
fruition), and escape (as Nibbana); cf. five kinds of deliverance (e.g. M-a IV 168). The
three (see e.g. Nidd I 26; M-a II 143) are bodily seclusion (retreat), mental seclusion
(jhana), and seclusion from the substance or circumstances of becoming (Nibbana).
24. Here sankappa ("thinking") has the meaning of "hankering." Chanda, katna and
raga and their combinations need sorting out. Chanda (zeal, desire) is much used,
neutral in colour, good or bad according to context and glossed by "desire to act";
technically also one of the four roads to power and four predominances. Kama (sense
desire, sensuality) loosely represents enjoyment of the five sense pleasures (e.g.
sense-desire sphere). More narrowly it refers to sexual enjoyment (third of the Five
Precepts). Distinguished as subjective desire (defilement) and objective things that
arouse it (Nidd 11; cf. Ch. XIV n.36). The figure "five cords of sense desire" signifies
simply these desires with the five sense objects that attract them. Raga (greed) is the
general term for desire in its bad sense and identical with lobha, which latter, however,
appears technically as one of the three root-causes of unprofitable action. Raga is
renderable also by "lust" in its general sense. Kaniacchanda (lust): a technical term for
`135
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
in renunciation is indicated by the second since it expresses seclusion from
sense desire as defilement.
84.	And with sense desires as object and sense desires as defilement expressed
in this way it should also be recognized that the abandoning of the objective
basis for defilement is indicated by the first of these two phrases and the
abandoning of the [subjective] defilement by the second; also that the giving up
of the cause of cupidity is indicated by the first and [the giving up of the cause]
of stupidity by the second; also that the purification of one's occupation is
indicated by the first and the educating of one's inclination by the second.
This, firstly, is the method here when the words from sense desires are treated as
referring to sense desires as object.
85.	But if they are treated as referring to sense desires as defilement, then it is
simply just zeal for sense desires (kamacchanda) in the various forms of zeal
(chanda), greed {raga), etc., that is intended as "sense desires" (kama) (§83, 2nd
quotation). [141] And although that [lust] is also included by [the word]
"unprofitable," it is nevertheless stated separately in the Vibhanga in the way
beginning, "Herein, what are sense desires? Zeal as sense desire ..." (Vibh 256)
because of its incompatibility with jhana. Or, alternatively it is mentioned in the
first phrase because it is sense desire as defilement and in the second phrase
because it is included in the "unprofitable." And because this [lust] has various
forms, therefore "from sense desires" is said instead of "from sense desire."
86. And although there may be unprofitableness in other states as well,
nevertheless only the hindrances are mentioned subsequently in the Vibhanga
thus, "Herein, what states are unprofitable? Lust ..." (Vibh 256), etc., in order to
show their opposition to, and incompatibility with, the jhana factors. For the
hindrances are the contrary opposites of the jhana factors: what is meant is that
the jhana factors are incompatible with them, eliminate them, abolish them. And
it is said accordingly in the Petaka (Petakopadesa): "Concentration is incompatible
with lust, happiness with ill will, applied thjought with stiffness and torpor,
bliss with agitation and worry and sustained thought with uncertainty" (not in
Petakopadesa).
87. So in this case it should be understood that seclusion by suppression
(suspension) of lust is indicated by the phrase quite secluded from sense desires,
and seclusion by suppression (suspension) of [all] five hindrances by the phrase
secluded from unprofitable things. But omitting repetitions, that of lust is
indicated by the first and that of the remaining hindrances by the second.
Similarly with the three unprofitable roots, that of greed, which has the five
cords of sense desire (M I 85) as its province, is indicated by the first, and that of
hate and delusion, which have as their respective provinces the various grounds
for annoyance (A IV 408; V 150), etc., bv the second. Or with the states consisting
of the floods, etc., that of the flood of sense desires, of the bond of sense desires, of
the canker of sense desires, of sense-desire clinging, of the bodily tie of
the first of the five hindrances. Chanda-raga (zeal and greed) and kama-raga (greed for
sense desires) have no technical use.
`136
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
covetousness, and of the fetter of greed for sense desires, is indicated by the first,
and that of the remaining floods, bonds, cankers, clingings, ties, and fetters, is
indicated by the second. Again, that of craving and of what is associated with
craving is indicated by the first, and that of ignorance and of what is associated
with ignorance is indicated by the second. Furthermore, that of the eight thought-
arisings associated with greed (XIV90) is indicated by the first, and that of the
remaining kinds of unprofitable thought-arisings is indicated by the second.
This, in the first place, is the explanation of the meaning of the words "quite
secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things."
88. So far the factors abandoned by the jhana have been shown. And now, in
order to show the factors associated with it, which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought is said. [142] Herein, applied thinking (vitakkana) is applied
thought (vitakka); hitting upon, is what is meant.25 It has the characteristic of
directing the mind on to an object (mounting the mind on its object). Its function
is to strike at and thresh—for the meditator is said, in virtue of it, to have the
object struck at by applied thought, threshed bv applied thought. It is manifested
as the leading of the mind onto an object. Sustained thinking (vicarana) is sustained
thought (vicara); continued sustainment (anusancarana), is what is meant. It has
the characteristic of continued pressure on (occupation with) the object. Its
function is to keep conascent [mental] states [occupied] with that. It is manifested
as keeping consciousness anchored [on that object].
89. And, though sometimes not separate, applied thought is the first impact of
the mind in the sense that it is both gross and inceptive, like the striking of a bell.
Sustained thought is the act of keeping the mind anchored, in the sense that it is
subtle with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the ringing of the
bell. Applied thought intervenes, being |the interference of consciousness at the
time of first arousing [thought], like a bird's spreading out its wings when
about to soar into the air, and like a bee's diving towards a lotus when it is
minded to follow up the scent of it. The behaviour of sustained thought is quiet,
being the near non-interference of consciousness, like the bird's planing with
outspread wines after soaring into the air, and like the bee's buzzing above the
lotus after it has dived towards it.
90. In the commentary to the Book of Twos26 this is said: "Applied thought
occurs as a state of directing the mind onto an object, like the movement of a
large bird taking off into the air by engaging the air with both wings and
forcing them downwards. For it causes absorption by being unified. Sustained
thought occurs with the individual essence of continued pressure, like the bird's
movement when it is using (activating) its wings for the purpose of keeping
25.	Uliana—"hitting upon": possibly connected with iihanati (to disturb—see M I
243; II 193). Obviously connected here with the meaning of ahananapariyahanana
("striking and threshing") in the next line. For the similes that follow here, see Pet 142.
26.	Of the Anguttara Nikaya? [The original could not be traced anywhere in the
Tipi taka, Atthakatha, and other texts contained in the digitalised Chattha San|gavana
edition of the Vipassana Research Institute. Dhs-a 114 quotes the same passage, but
gives the source as attliakathayam, "in the commentary" BPS ed.]
`137
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
hold on the air. For it keeps pressing the object27". That fits in with the latter's
occurrence as anchoring. This difference of theirs becomes evident in the first
and second jhanas [in the fivefold reckoning].
91.	Furthermore, applied thought is like the hand that grips firmly and sustained
thought is like the hand that rubs, when one grips a tarnished metal dish firmly
with one hand and rubs it with powder and oil and a woollen pad with the
other hand. Likewise, when a potter has spun his| wheel with a stroke on the
stick and is making a dish [143], his supporting hand is like applied thought and
his hand that moves back and forth is like sustained thought. Likewise, when one
is drawing a circle, the pin that stays fixed down in the centre is like applied
thought, which directs onto the object, and the pin that revolves round it is like
sustained thought, which continuously presses.
92.	So this jhana occurs together with this applied thought and this sustained
thought and it is called, "accompanied by applied and sustained thought" as a
tree is called "accompanied by flowers and fruits." But in the Vibhanga the
teaching is given in terms of a person28 in the way beginning, "He is possessed,
fully possessed, of this applied thought and this sustained thought" (Vibh
257). The meaning should be regarded in the same way there too.
93.	Born of seclusion: here secludedness (vivitti) is seclusion (viveka); the meaning
is, disappearance of hindrances. Or alternatively it is secluded (vivitta), thus it is
seclusion; the meaning is, the collection of states associated with the jhana is
secluded from hindrances. "Born of seclusion" is born of or in that kind of
seclusion.
94.	Happiness and bliss: it refreshes (plnayati), thus it is happiness (piti). It has
the characteristic of endearing (sampiyayana). Its function is to refresh the body
and the mind; or its function is to pervade (thrill with rapture). It is manifested
as elation. But it is of five kinds as minor happiness, momentary happiness,
showering happiness, uplifting happiness, and pervading (rapturous)
happiness.
Herein, minor happiness is only able to raise the hairs on the body Momentary
happiness is like flashes of lightning at different moments. Showering happiness
breaks over the body again and again like waves on the sea shore.
95. Uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body and
make it spring up into the air. For this was what happened to the Elder
Maha-Tissa, resident at Punnavallika. He went to the shrine terrace on the
evening of the full-moon day Seeing the moonlight, he faced in the direction
of the Great Shrine [at Anuradhapura], thinking, "At this very hour the four

are not in Be and Ae.
28.	Piiggaladhittliana—"in terms of a person"; a technical commentarial term for one
of the ways of presenting a subject. They are dhamma-desana (discourse about
principles), and pnggala-desana (discourse about persons), both of which may be treated
either as dharnrnadhitthana (in terms of principles) or piiggaladhittliana (in terms of
persons). See M-a I 24.
`138
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
assemblies29 are worshipping at the Great Shrine!" By means of objects
formerly seen [there] he aroused uplifting happiness with the Enlightened
One as object, and he rose into the air like a painted ball bounced off a
plastered floor and alighted on the terrace of the Great Shrine.
96. And this was what happened to the daughter of a clan in the village of
Vattakalaka near the Girikandaka Monastery when she sprang up into the air
owing to strong uplifting happiness with the Enlightened 0|ne as object. As her
parents were about to go to the monastery in the evening, it seems, in order to
hear the Dhamma [144], they told her: "Mv dear, you are expecting a child; you
cannot go out at an unsuitable time. We shall hear the Dhamma and gain merit
for you." So they went out. And though she wanted to go too, she could not well
object to what they said. She stepped out of the house onto a balcony and stood
looking at the Akasacetiva Shrine at Girikandaka lit by the moon. She saw the
offering of lamps at the shrine, and the four communities as they circumambulated
it to the right after making their offerings of flowers and perfumes; and she
heard the sound of the massed recital by the Community of Bhikkhus. Then she
thought: "How lucky they are to be able to go to the monastery and wander round
such a shrine terrace and listen to such sweet preaching of Dhamma!" Seeing the
shrine as a mound of pearls and arousing uplifting happiness, she sprang up into
the air, and before her parents arrived she came down from the air into the shrine
terrace, where she paid homage and stood listening to the Dhamma.
97. When her parents arrived, they asked her, "What road did you come by?"
She said, "I came through the air, not by the road," and when they told her, "Mv
dear, those whose cankers are destroyed come through the air. But how did you
come?" she replied: "As I was standing looking at the shrine in the moonlight a
strong sense of happiness arose in me with the Enlightened One as its object.
Then I knew no more whether I was standing or sitting, but only that I was
springing up into the air with the sign [that I had grasped, and I came to rest on
this shrine terrace."
So uplifting happiness can be powerful enough to levitate the body, make it
spring up into the air.
98.	But when pervading (rapturous) happiness arises, the whole body is
completely pervaded, like a filled bladder, like a rock cavern invaded by a huge
inundation.
99.	Now, this fivefold happiness, when conceived and matured, perfects the twofold
tranquillity that is, bodily and mental tranquillity When tranquillity is conceived
and matured, it perfects the twofold bliss, that is, bodily and mental bliss. When bliss
is conceived and matured, it perfects the threefold concentration, that is,
momentary concentration, access concentration, and absorption concentration.
Of these, what is intended in this context by happiness is pervading happiness,
which is the root of absorption and comes by growth into association with
absorption. [145]
29. The four assemblies (parisa) are the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen follo|wers and
laywomen followers.
`139
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
100. But as to the other word: pleasing (sukhana) is bliss (suklia). Or alternatively:
it thoroughly (SUtthu) devours (KHAdati), consumes (KHAnati),30 bodily and
mental affliction, thus it is bliss (suklia). It has gratifying as its characteristic. Its
function is to intensify associated states. It is manifested as aid.
And wherever the two are associated, happiness is the contentedness at
getting a desirable object, and bliss is the actual experiencing of it when got.
Where there is happiness there is bliss (pleasure); but where there is bliss there
is not necessarily happiness. Happiness is included in the formations aggregate;
bliss is included in the feeling aggregate. If a man, exhausted31 in a desert, saw
or heard about a pond on the edge of a wood, he would have happiness; if he
went into the wood's shade and used the water, he would have bliss. And it
should be understood that this is said because they are obvious on such
occasions.
101.	Accordingly, (a) this happiness and this bliss are of this jhana, or in this
jhana; so in this way this jhana is qualified by the words with happiness and bliss
[and also born of seclusion]. Or alternatively: (b) the words happiness and bliss
(pltisukham) can be taken as "the happiness and the bliss" independently like
"the Dhamma and the Discipline" (dhammavinaya), and so then it can be taken
as seclusion-born happiness-and-bliss of this jhana, or in this jhana; so in this
way it is the happiness and bliss [rather than the jhana] that are born of seclusion.
For just as the words "born of seclusion" can [as at (a)] be taken as qualifying the
word "jhana," so too they can] be taken here [as at (b)] as qualifying the expression
"happiness and bliss," and then that [total expression] is predicated of this
[jhana]. So it is also correct to call "happiness-and-bliss born-of-seclusion" a
single expression. In the Vibhanga it is stated in the way beginning, "This bliss
accompanied bv this happiness" (Vibh 257). The meaning should be regarded
in the same way there too.
102.	First jhana: this will be explained below (§119).
Enters upon (upasampajja): arrives at; reaches, is what is meant; or else, taking
it as "makes enter" (upasampadayitva), then producing, is what is meant. In the
Vibhanga this is said: "'Enters upon': the gaining, the regaining, the reaching,
the arrival at, the touching, the realizing of, the entering upon (upasampada, the
first jhana" (Vibh 257), the meaning of which should be regarded in the same
way.
103. And dwells in (viharati): by becoming possessed of jhana of the kind
described above through dwelling in a posture favourable to that [jhana], he
produces a posture, a procedure, a keeping, an enduring, a lasting, a behaviour,
a dwelling, of the person. For this is said in the Vibhanga: '"Dwells in': poses,
30.	For this word play see also XVII.48. Klianati is only given in normal meaning of
"to dig" in PED. There seems to be some confusion of meaning with khayati (to
destroy) here, perhaps suggested by khadati (to eat). This suggests a rendering here
and in Ch. XVII of "to consume" which makes sense. Glossed by avadariyati, to break
or dig: not in PED. See CPD "avadarana."
31.	Kantara-khinna—"exhausted in a desert"; khinna is not in PED
`140
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
proceeds, keeps, endures, lasts, behaves, dwells; [146] hence 'dwells' is said"
(Vibh 252).
104.	Now, it was also said above which abandons five factors> possesses five factors
(§79; cf. M1294). Herein, the abandoning of the five factors should be understood
as the abandoning of these five hindrances, namely lust, ill will, stiffness and
torpor, agitation and worry, and uncertainty; for no jhana arises until these have
been abandoned, and so they are called the factors of abandoning. For although
other unprofitable things too are abandoned at the moment of jhana, still only
these are specifically obstructive to jhana.
105.	The mind affected through lust by greed for varied objective fields does
not become concentrated on an object consisting in unity or being overwhelmed
by lust, it does not enter on the way to abandoning the sense-desire element.
When pestered by ill will towards an object, it does not occur uninterruptedly
When overcome bv stiffness and torpor, it is unwieldy. When seized by agitation
and worry, it is unquiet and buzzes about. When stricken by uncertainty it fails
to mount the way to accomplish the attainment of jhana. So it is these only that
are called factors of abandoning because they are specifically obstructive to
jhana.
106.	But applied thought directs the mind onto the object; sustained thought
keeps it anchored there. Happiness produced by the success of the effort refreshes
the mind whose effort has succeeded through not being distracted by those
hindrances; and bliss intensifies it for the same reason. Then unification aided
by this directing onto, this anchoring, this refreshing and this intensifying,
evenly and rightly centres (III.3) the mind with its remaining associated states
on the object consisting in unity. Consequently possession of five factors should
be understood as the arising of these five, namely applied thought, sustained
thought, happiness, bliss and unification of mind.
107.	For it is when these are arisen that jhana is said to be arisen, w|hich is why
they are called the five factors of possession. Therefore it should not be assumed
that the jhana is something other which possesses them. But just as "The army
with the four factors" (Vin IV 104) and "Music with the five factors" (M-a II 300)
and "The path with the eight factors (eightfold path)" are stated simply in terms
of their factors, so this too [147] should be understood as stated simply in terms
of its factors, when it is said to "have five factors" or "possess five factors."
108. And while these five factors are present also at the moment of access and
are stronger in access than in normal consciousness, they are still stronger here
than in access and acquire the characteristic of the fine-material sphere. For
applied thought arises here directing the mind on to the object in an extremely
lucid manner, and sustained thought does so pressing the object very hard, and
the happiness and bliss pervade the entire body Hence| it is said: "And there is
nothing of his whole bodv not permeated by the happiness and bliss born of
seclusion" (D I 73). And unification too arises in the complete contact with the
object that the surface of a box's lid has with the surface of its base. This is how
thev differ from the others.
`141
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
109.	Although unification of mind is not actually listed among these factors
in the [summary] version [beginning] "which is accompanied by applied and
sustained thought" (Vibh 245), nevertheless it is mentioned [later] in the
Vibhanga as follows: "'Jhana': it is applied thought, sustained thought,
happiness, bliss, unification"(Vibh 257), and so it is a factor too; for the intention
with which the Blessed One gave the summary is the same as that with which he
gave the exposition that follows it.
110.	Is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics (§79): the goodness in three
ways is in the beginning, middle, and end. The possession of the ten characteristics
should be understood as the characteristics of the beginning, middle, and end,
too. Here is the text:
111.	"Of the first jhana, purification of the wav is the beginning, intensification
of equanimity is the middle, and satisfaction is the end.
— —1............/ ^ ----- -----------'---------------------- ----- ------
"'Of the first jhana, purification of the way is the beginning': how many
characteristics has the beginning? The beginning has three characteristics: the
mind is purified of obstructions to that [jhana]; because it is purified the mind
makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity;
because it has made way the mind enters into that state. And it is since the mind
becomes purified of obstructions and, through being purified, makes way for the
central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity and, having made way
enters into that state, that the purification of the way is the beginning of the first
jhana. These are the three characteristics of the beginning. Hence it is said: The first
jhana is good in the beginning which possesses three characteristics.' [148]
112. "'Of the first jhana intensification of equanimity is the middle': how many
characteristics has the middle? The middle has thre^ characteristics. He [now]
looks on with equanimity at the mind that is purified; he looks on with equanimity
at it as having made way for serenity; he looks on with equanimity at the
appearance of unity.32 And in that he [now] looks on with equanimity at the
mind that is purified and looks on with equanimity at it as having made wav for
serenity and looks on with equanimity at the appearance of unity, that
7	I	7	I I	7'
intensification of equanimity is the middle of the first jhana. These are the three
characteristics of the middle. Hence it is said: The first jhana is good in the
middle which possesses three characteristics.'
113. "'Of the first jhana satisfaction is the end': how many characteristics has
the end? The end has four characteristics. The satisfaction in the sense that there
was non-excess of any of the states arisen therein, and the satisfaction in the
sense that the faculties had a single function, and the satisfaction in the sense
32. Four unities (ekatta) are given in the preceding paragraph of the same Patisambhida
ref.: "The unity consisting in the appearance of relinquishment in the act of giving, which
is found in those resolved upon generosity (giving up); the unity consisting in the
appearance of the sign of serenity which is found in those who devote themselves to the
higher consciousness; the unity consisting in the appearance of the characteristic of fall,
which is found in those with insight; the unity consisting in the appearance) of cessation,
which is found in noble persons" (Paris 1167). The second is meant here.
`142
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
that the appropriate energy was effective, and the satisfaction in the sense of
repetition, are the satisfaction in the end of the first jhana. These are the four
characteristics of the end. Hence it is said: The first jhana is good in the end
which possesses four characteristics'" (Patis I 167-68).
114. Herein, purification of the way is access together with its concomitants.
Intensification of equanimity is absorption. Satisfaction is reviewing. So some
comment.33 But it is said in the text, "The mind arrived at unity enters into
purification of the way is intensified in equanimity and is satisfied by knowledge"
(Patis I 167), and therefore it is from the standpoint within actual absorption
that purification of the way firstly should be understood as the approach, with
intensification of equanimity as the function of equanimity consisting in specific
neutrality and satisfaction as the manifestation of clarifying knowledge's function
in accomplishing non-excess of states. How?
115.	Firstly in a cycle [of consciousness] in which absorption arises the mind
becomes purified from the group of defilements called hindrances that are an
obstruction to jhana. Being devoid of obstruction because it has been purified, it
makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of serenity.
Now, it is the absorption concentration itself occurring evenly that is called
the sign of serenity. But the consciousness immediately before that [149] reaches
that state by way of change in a single continuity (cf. XXII. 1-6), and so it is
said that it makes way for the central [state of equilibrium, which is the] sign of
serenity. And it is said that it enters into that state by approaching it through
having made way for it. That is why in the first place purification of the way,
while referring to aspects existing in the preceding consciousness, should
nevertheless be understood as the approach at the moment oij the first jhana's
actual arising.
116.	Secondly when he has more interest in purifying, since there is no need to
re-purify what has already been purified thus, it is said that he looks on with
equanimity at the mind that is purified. And when he has no more interest in
concentrating again what has already made way for serenity by arriving at the
state of serenity it is said that he looks on with equanimity at it as having made way
for serenity. And when he has no more interest in again causing appearance of
unity in what has already appeared as unity through abandonment of its
association with defilement in making way for serenity it is said that he looks on
with equanimity at the appearance of unity. That is why intensification of equanimity
should be understood as the function of equanimity that consists in specific
neutrality
117. And lastly when equanimity was thus intensified, the states called
concentration and understanding produced there, occurred coupled together
without either one exceeding the other. And also the [five] faculties beginning
with faith occurred with the single function (taste) of deliverance owing to
deliverance from the various defilements. And also the energy appropriate to
that, which was favourable to their state of non-excess and single function, was
33. "The inmates of the Abhayagiri Monastery in Anuradhapura" (Vism-mht 144).
`143
Chapter IV

effective. And also its repetition occurs at that moment.34 Now, all these [four]
aspects are only produced because it is after seeing with knowledge the various
dangers in defilement and advantages in cleansing that satisfiedness,
purifiedness and clarifiedness ensue accordingly That is the reason why it was
said that satisfaction should be understood as the manifestation of clarifying
knowledge's function in accomplishing non-excess, etc., of states (§114).
118. Herein, satisfaction as a function of knowledge is called "the end" since
the knowledge is evident as due to onlooking equanimity according as it is
said: "He looks on with complete equanimity at the mind thus exerted; then the
understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to equanimity
Owing to equanimity the mind is liberated from the many sorts of defilements;
then the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to
liberation. Because of being liberated these states come to have a single function;
then [the understanding faculty is outstanding as understanding due to]
development in the sense of the single function"35 (Patis II 25).
119.	Now, as to the words and so he has attained the first jhana ... of the earth kasina
(§79): Here it is first because it starts a numerical series; [150] also it is first
because it arises first. It is called jhana because of lighting (upanijjhana) the
object and because of burning up (jhdpana) opposition (Patis I 49). The disk of
earth is called earth kasina (pathaznkasina—lit. "earth universal") in the sense of
entirety36 and the sign acquired with that as its support and also the jhana
acquired in the earth-kasina sign are so called too. So that jhana should be
understood as of the earth kasina in this sense, with reference to which it was said
above "and so he has attained to the first jhana ... of the earth kasina."
120.	When it has been attained in this way, the mode of its attainment must be
discerned by the meditator as if he were a hair-splitter or a cook. For when a very
skilful archer, who is working to split a hair, actually splits the hair on one
occasion, he discerns the modes of the position of his feet, the bow, the bowstring,
and the arrow thus: "I split the hair as I stood thus, with the bow thus, the
bowstring thus, the arrow thus." From then on he recaptures those same modes
and repeats the splitting of the hair without fail. So too the meditator must
discern such modes as that of suitable food, etc., thus: "I attained this after
eating this food, attending on such a person, in such a lodging, in this posture
at this time." In this way, when that [absorption] is lost, he will be able to recapture
those modes and renew the absorption, or while familiarizing himself with it he
will be able to repeat that absorption again and again.
121. And just as when a skilled cook is sjerving his employer, he notices
whatever he chooses to eat and from then on brings onlv that sort and so obtains
34.	"'Its': of that jhana consciousness. 'At that moment': at the moment of dissolution;
for when the moment of arising is past, repetition occurs starting with the moment of
presence" (Vism-mht 145). A curious argument; see §182.
35.	The quotation is incomplete and the end should read, "... ekarasatthena
bhavanavasena pannavasena pamiindriyam adhirnattam hoti."
36.	"In die sense of the jhana's entire object. It is not made its partial object" (Vism-mht 147).
`144
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
a reward, so too this meditator discerns such modes as that of the food, etc., at the
time of the attaining, and he recaptures them and re-obtains absorption each
time it is lost. So he must discern the modes as a hair-splitter or a cook does.
122. And this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, suppose a wise,
clever, skilful cook set various kinds of sauces before a king or a king's minister,
such as sour, bitter, sharp, [151] sweet, peppery and unpeppery salty and unsalty
sauces; then the wise, clever, skilful cook learned his master's sign thus 'today
this sauce pleased my master' or 'he held out his hand for this one' or 'he took
a lot of this one' or 'he praised this one' or 'today the sour kind pleased my
master' or 'he held out his hand for the sour kind' or 'he took a lot of the sour
kind' or 'he praised the sour kind' ... or 'he praised the unsalty kind'; then the
wise, clever, skilful cook is rewarded with clothing and wages and presents.
Why is that? Because that wise, clever, skilful cook learned his master's sign in
this way. So too, bhikkhus, here a wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu dwells
contemplating the body as a body ... He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings
... consciousness as consciousness ... mental objects as mental objects, ardent,
fully aware and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.
As he dwells contemplating mental objects as mental objects, his mind becomes
concentrated, his defilements are abandoned. He learns the sign of that. Then
that wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu is rewarded with a happy abiding here and
now, he is rewarded with mindfulness and full awareness. Why is that? Because
that wise, clever, skilful bhikkhu learned his consciousness's sign" (S V 151-52).
123.	And when he recaptures those modes by apprehending the sign, he just
succeeds in reaching absorption, but not in making it last. It lasts when it is
absolutely purified from states that obstruct concentration.
124.	When a bhikkhu enters upon a jhana without [first] completely
suppressing lust by reviewing the dangers in sense desires, etc., and without
[first] completely tranquillizing bodily irritability37 by tranquillizing the body
and without [first] completely removing stiffness and torpor by bringing to
mind the elements of initiative, etc., (§55), and without [first] completely
abolishing agitation and worry by bringing to mind the sign of serenity etc.,
[152] and without [first] completely purifying his mind of other states that
obstruct concentration, then that bhikkhu soon comes out of that jhana again,
like a bee that has gone into an unpurified hive, like a king who has gone into an
unclean park.
125. But when he enters upon a jhana after [first] completely purifying his
mind of states that obstruct concentration, then he remains in the attainment
even for a whole day like a bee that has gone into a completely purified hive, like
a king who has gone into a perfectly clean park. Hence the Ancients said:
37. Kaya-dnttlndla—"bodily irritability": explained here as "bodily disturbance
(daratha), excitement of the body (kaya-saraddhata)" by Vism-mht (p.148); here it
represents the hindrance of ill will; cf. M III 151,159, where commented on as kayalasiya—
"bodily inertia" (M-a IV 202, 208). PED, only gives meaning of "wicked, lewd" for
duthulla, for which meaning see e.g. A I 88, Vin-a 528; cf. IX.69.
`145
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
"So let him dispel any sensual lust, and resentment,
Agitation as well, and then torpor, and doubt as the fifth;
There let him find joy with a heart that is glad in seclusion,
Like a king in a garden where all and each corner is clean."
126. So if he wants to remain long in the jhana, he must enter upon it after
[first] purifying his mind] from obstructive states.
[Extension of the Sign]
In order to perfect the development of consciousness he should besides extend
the counterpart sign according as acquired. Now, there are two planes for
extension, namely access and absorption; for it is possible to extend it on reaching
access and on reaching absorption. But the extending should be done
consistently in one [or the other], which is why it was said "he should besides
extend the counterpart sign according as acquired."
127.	The wav to extend it is this. The meditator should not extend the sign as a
clay bowl or a cake or boiled rice or a creeper or a piece of cloth is extended. He
should first delimit with his mind successive sizes for the sign, according as
acquired, that is to say, one finger, two fingers, three fingers, four fingers, and
then extend it by the amount delimited, just as a ploughman delimits with the
plough the area to be [ploughed and then ploughs within the area delimited, or
just as bhikkhus fixing a boundary first observe the marks and then fix it. He
should not, in fact, extend it without having delimited [the amount it is to be
extended by]. After that has been done, he can further extend it, doing so by
delimiting successive boundaries of, say a span, a ratana (-2 spans), the veranda,
the surrounding space,38 the monastery and the boundaries of the village, the
town, the district, the kingdom and the ocean, [153] making the extreme limit
the world-sphere or even beyond.
128.	Just as young swans first starting to use their wings soar a little distance
at a time, and by gradually increasing it eventually reach the presence of the
moon and sun, so too when a bhikkhu extends the sign by successive
delimitations in the way described, he can extend it up to the limit of the world-
sphere or even beyond.
129. Then that sign [appears] to him like an ox hide stretched out with a
hundred pegs39 over the earth's ridges and hollows, river ravines, tracts of scrub
and thorns, and rocky inequalities (see M III 105) in any area to which it has
been extended.
38.	For pamukha—"veranda" see n. 2 above. Parivena—"surrounding space": this
meaning, not given in PED, is brought out clearly in XI.7.
39.	Samabbhafuita—"stretch flat": not in this sense in PED. This word replaces the
word snviliata used at M III 105 where this clause is borrowed from. At XI.92, the same
word (apparently in another sense) is glossed by pellana = "pushing" (not in PED) at
Vism-mht 362. M-a IV 153 glosses suviliata with "pasaretva sutthn viliata" which
suggests "stretched" rather than "beaten"; harati rather than hanati.
`146
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
When a beginner has reached the first jhana in this sign, he should enter
upon it often without reviewing it much. For the first jhana factors occur crudely
and weaklv in one who reviews it much. Then because of that they do not become
conditions for higher endeavour. While he is endeavouring for the unfamiliar
[higher jhana] he falls away from the first jhana and fails to reach the second.
130. Hence the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, suppose there were a foolish
stupid mountain cow, with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking
on craggy mountains, who thought: 'What if I walked in a direction I never
walked in before, ate grass I never ate before, drank water I never drank before?'
and without placing her forefoot properly she lifted up her hind foot; then
she would not walk in the direction she never walked in before or eat the
grass she never ate before or drink the water she never drank before, and also
she would not get back safely to the place where she had thought, 'What if I
walked in a direction I never walked in before ... drank water I never drank
before?' Why is that? Because that mountain cow was foolish and stupid
with no knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains.
So too, bhikkhus, here is a certain foolish stupid bhikkhu with no knowledge
of fields and no skill, quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from
unprofitable things, in entering upon and dwelling in the first jhana, which
is accompanied by applied thought and sustained thought with happiness
and bliss born of seclusion; he does not repeat, develop or cultivate that sign
or properly establish it. He thinks: 'What if with the subsiding of applied
and sustained thought I entered upon and dwelt in the second jhana, which
is ... with happiness and bliss born of concentration?' [154] He is unable
with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought to enter upon and
dwell in the second jhana, which is ... with happiness and bliss born of
concentration. Then he thinks: 'What if, quite secluded from sense desires,
secluded from unprofitable things, I entered upon and dwelt in the first jhana,
which is ... with happiness and bliss born of seclusion?' He is unable, quite
secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things, to enter upon
and dwell in the first jhana which is ... with happiness and bliss born of
seclusion. This bhikkhu is called one who has slipped between the two, who
has fallen between the two, just like the foolish stupid mountain cow with no
knowledge of fields and no skill in walking on craggy mountains ..." (A IV
418-19).
131.	Therefore he should acquire mastery in the five ways first of all with
respect to the first jhana. Herein, these are the five kinds of mastery: mastery in
adverting, mastery in attaining, mastery in resolving (steadying the duration),
mastery in emerging, and mastery in reviewing. "He adverts to the first jhana
where, when, and for as long as, he wishes; he has no difficulty in adverting;
thus it is mastery in adverting. He attains the first jhana where ... he has no
difficulty in attaining; thus it is mastery in attaining" (Patis I 100), and all the
rest should be quoted in detail (XXIII.27).
132.	The explanation of the meaning here is this. When he emerges from the
first jhana and first of all adverts to the applied thought, then, next to the
`147
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
adverting that arose interrupting the life-continuum, either four or five impulsions
impel with that applied thought as their object. Then there are two life-continuum
[consciousnesses]. Then there is adverting with the sustained thought as its
object and followed by impulsions in the way just stated. When he is able to
prolong his conscious process uninterruptedly in this way with the five jhana
factors, then his mastery of adverting is successful. But this mastery is found at
its acme of perfection in the Blessed One's Twin Marvel (Patis I 125), or for
others on the aforesaid occasions. There is no quicker mastery in adverting than
that.
133.	The venerable Maha-Moggallana's ability to enter upon jhana quickly as
in the taming of the royal naga-serpent Nandopananda (XII.106f.), is called
mastery in attaining.
134.	Ability to remain in jhana for a moment consisting in exactly a finger-
snap or exactly ten finger-snaps is called mastery in resolving (steadying the
duration).
Ability to emerge quickly in the same way is called mastery in emerging.
135.	The story of the Elder Buddharakkliita may be told in order to illustrate
both these last. [155] Eight years after his admission to the Community that elder
was sitting in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessed of supernormal
powers who had gathered to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Maha-
Rohanagutta at Therambatthala. He saw a royal supanna (bird) swooping down
from the sky intending to seize an attendant royal naga-serpent as he was
getting rice-gruel accepted for the elder. The Elder Buddharakkhita created a
rock meanwhile, and seizing the royal naga by the arm, he pushed him inside it.
The royal supanna gave the rock a blow and made off. The senior elder remarked:
"Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there, we should all have been put to shame."40
136.	Mastery in reviewing is described in the same way as mastery in adverting;
for the reviewing impulsions are in fact those next to the adverting mentioned
there (§132).
137.	When he has once acquired mastery in these five wavs, then on emerging
from the now familiar first jhana he can regard the flaws in it in this way: "This
attainment is threatened bv the nearness of the hindrances, and its factors are
weakened by the grossness of the applied and sustained thought." He can
bring the second jhana to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first
jhana and set about doing what is needed for attaining the second.
138. When he has emerged from the first jhana, applied and sustained thought
appear gross to him as he reviews the jhana factors with mindfulness and full
awareness, while happiness and bliss and unification of mind appear peaceful.
Then, as he brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth" again and again
40. What the story is trying to illustrate is the rapidity with which the elder entered
the jhana, controlled its duration, and emerged, which is the necessary preliminary to
the working of a marvel (the creation of a rock in this case; XII.57). The last remark
seems to indicate that all the others would have been too slow (see Vism-mht 150).
`148
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
with the purpose of abandoning the gross factors and obtaining the peaceful
factors, [knowing] "now the second jhana will arise," there arises in him
mind-door adverting with that same earth kasina as its object, interrupting the
life-continuum. After that, either four or five impulsions impel on that same
object, the last one of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere belonging
to the second jhana. The rest are of the sense sphere of the kinds already stated (§74).
[The Second Jhana]
139. And at this point, "With the stilling of applied and sustained thought he
enters upon and dwells in the second jhana, which has internal confidence and
singleness of mind without applied thought, without sustained thought, with
happiness and bliss born of concentration" (Vibh 245), and so he has attained
the second jhana, which abandons two factors, possesses three factors, is good
------ ’ — ' ———	—-----------r—— — — — ----o-----
in three wavs, possesses ten characteristics and is of the earth kasina. [156]
140.	Herein, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought: with the stilling,
with the surmounting, of these two, namely, applied thought and sustained
thought; with their non-manifestation at the moment of the second jhana, is
what is meant. Herein, although none of the states belonging to the first jhana
exist in the second jhana—for the contact, etc. (see M III 25), in the first jhana are
one and here they are another—it should be understood all the same that the
phrase "with the stilling of applied and sustained thought" is expressed in this
way in order to indicate that the attaining of the other jhanas, beginning with
that of the second from the first, is effected by the surmounting of the gross
factor in each case.
141.	Internal: here one's own internal41 is intended; but that much is actually
stated in the Vibhanga too with the words "internally in oneself" (Vibh 258).
And since one's own internal is intended, the meaning here is this: born in
oneself, generated in one's own continuity
142.	Confidence: it is faith that is called confidence. The jhana "has confidence"
because it is associated with confidence as a cloth "has blue colour" because it
is associated with blue colour. Or alternatively, that jhana is stated to "have
confidence" because it makes the mind confident with the confidence possessed
by it and by stilling the disturbance created by applied and sustained thought.
And with this conception of the meaning the word construction must be taken
as "confidence of mind." But with the first-mentioned conception of the meaning
the words "of mind" must be construed with "singleness42".
143. Here is the construction of the meaning in that case. Unique (eka) it comes
up (udeti), thus it is single (ekodi); the meaning is, it comes up as the superlative,
the best, because it is not overtopped by applied and sustained thought, for the
best is called "unique" in the world. Or it is permissible to say that when deprived
4l|. See XIV192 and note.
42. In the Pali, sampasadanarn cetaso ekodibltavarn: cetaso ("of mind") comes between
sampasadanarn ("confidence") and ekodibltavarn ("singleness") and so can be construed
with either.
`149
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
of applied and sustained thought it is unique, without companion. Or
alternatively: it evokes (udayati) associated states, thus it is an evoker (udi); the
meaning is, it arouses. And that is unique (eka) in the sense of best, and it is an
evoker (udi), thus it is a unique evoker (ekodi = single). This is a term for
concentration. Then, since the second jhana gives existingness to (bhciveti),
augments, this single [thing], it "gives singleness" (ekodibhava). But as this
single [thing] is a mind's, not a being's or a soul's, so singleness of mind is said.
144. It might be asked: But does not this faith exist in the first jhana too, and
also this concentration with the name of the "single [thing]?" Then why is onlv
this second jhana said to have confidence and singleness of mind?—It may be
replied as follows: It is because that first jhana [157] is not fully confident owing
to the disturbance created bv applied and sustained thought, like water ruffled
by ripples and wavelets. That is why, although faith does exist in it, it is not
called "confidence." And there too concentration is not fully evident because of
the lack of full confidence. That is why it is not called "singleness" there. But in
this second jhana faith is strong, having got a footing in the absence of the
impediments of applied and sustained thought; and concentration is also
evident through having strong faith as its companion. That may be understood
as the reason why only this jhana is described in this way
145.	But that much is actually stated in the Vibhanga too with the words:
"'Confidence' is faith, having faith, trust, full confidence. 'Singleness of mind'
is steadiness of consciousness ... right concentration" (Vibh 258). And this
commentary on the meaning should not be so understood as to conflict with the
meaning stated in that way, but on the contrary so as to agree and concur with it.
146.	Without applied thought, without sustained thought: since it has been
abandoned by development, there is no applied thought in this, or of this, [jhana],
thus it is without applied thought. The same explanation applies to sustained
thought. Also it is said in the Vibhanga: "So this applied thought and this
sustained thought are quieted, quietened, stilled, set at rest, set quite at rest,
done away with, quite done away with,43 dried up, quite dried up, made an end
of; hence it is said: without applied thought, without sustained thought"
(Vibh 258).
Here it may be asked: Has not this meaning already been established by the
words "with the stilling of applied and sustained thought?" So why is it said
again "without applied thought, without sustained thoughts?"—It may be
replied: Yes, that meaning has already been established. But this does not indicate
that meaning. Did we not say earlier: "The phrase 'with the stilling of applied
and sustained thought' is expressed in this way in order to indicate that the act
of attaining the other jhanas, beginning with that of the second from the first, is
effected by the surmounting of the gross factor in each case?" (§140).
147. Besides, this confidence comes about with the act of stilling, not the
darkness of defilement, but the applied and sustained thought. And the
43. Appita—"done away with": Appita ti vinasam gamita ("Appita" means "made to go to
annihilation") (Vism-mht 153). This meaning, though not in PED, is given in CPD.
`150
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
singleness comes about, not as in access jhana with the abandoning of the
hindrances, nor as in the first jhana with the manifestation of the factors, but
with the act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first] clause
indicates the cause of the confidence and singleness. In the same way this jhana
is without applied thought and without sustained thought, not as in the third
and fourth jhanas or as in eye-consciousness, etc., with just absence, but with
the actual act of stilling the applied and sustained thought. So that [first clause]
also indicates the cause of the state without applied and sustained thought; it
does not indicate the bare absence of applied and sustained thought. [158] The
bare absence of applied and sustained thought is indicated by this [second]
clause, namely, "without applied thought, without sustained thought."
Consequently it needs to be stated notwithstanding that the first has already
been stated.
148.	Born of concentration: born of the first-jhana concentration, or born of
associated concentration, is the meaning. Herein, although the first was born of
associated concentration too, still it is only this concentration that is quite worthy
to be called "concentration" because of its complete confidence and extreme
immobility due to absence of disturbance b|y applied and sustained thought. So
only this [jhana] is called "born of concentration," and that is in order to
recommend it.
With happiness and bliss is as already explained. Second: second in numerical
series. Also second because entered upon second.
149.	Then it was also said above which abandons two factors, possesses three
factors (§139). Herein, the abandoning of two factors should be understood
as the abandoning of applied thought and sustained thought. But while the
hindrances are abandoned at the moment of the access of the first jhana, in
the case of this jhana the applied thought and sustained thought are not
abandoned at the moment of its access. It is only at the moment of actual
absorption that the jhana arises without them. Hence they are called its
factors of abandoning.
150.	Its possession of three factors should be understood as the arising of the
three, that is, happiness, bliss, and unification of mind. So when it is said in the
Vibhanga, "'Jhana': confidence, happiness, bliss, unification of mind" (Vibh
258), this is said figuratively in order to show that jhana with its equipment. But,
excepting the confidence, this jhana has literally three factors qua factors that
have attained to the characteristic of lighting (see §119), according as it is said:
"What is jhana of three factors on that occasion? It is happiness, bliss, unification
of mind" (Vibh 263).
The rest is as in the case of the first jhana.
151.	Once this has been obtained in this way, and he has mastery in the five
ways already described, then on emerging from the now familiar second jhana
he can regard the flaws in it thus: "This attainment is threatened by the nearness
of applied and sustained thought; 'Whatever there is in it of happiness, of mental
excitement, proclaims its grossness' (D I 37), and its factors are weakened by the
grossness of the happiness so expressed." He can bring the third jhana to mind
`151
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
as quieter and so end his attachment to the second jhana and set about doing
what is needed for attaining the third.
152. When he has emerged from the second jhana [159] happiness appears
gross to him as he reviews the jhana factors with mindfulness and full awareness,
while bliss and unification appear peaceful. Then as he brings that same sign to
mind as "earth, earth" again and again with the purpose of abandoning the
gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors, [knojwing] "now the third jhana
will arise," there arises in him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasina
as its object, interrupting the life-continuum. After that, either four or five
impulsions impel on that same object, the last one of which is an impulsion of
the fine-material sphere belonging to the third jhana. The rest are of the kinds
already stated (§74).
[The Third Jhana]
153. And at this point, "With the fading away of happiness as well he dwells
in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, he feels bliss with his body; he
enters upon and dwells in the third jhana, on account of which the Noble Ones
announce: 'He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful' (Vibh 245),
and so he has attained the third jhana, which abandons one factor, possesses
two factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten characteristics, and is of the
earth kasina.
154 Herein, with the fading away of happiness as well (pltiya ca in raga): fading
away is distaste for, or surmounting of, happiness of the kind already described.
But the words "as well" (ca) between the two [words pltiya and viraga] have the
meaning of a conjunction;44 they conjoin [to them] either the word "stilling" or
the expression "the stilling of applied and sustained thought" [in the description
of the second jhana]. Herein, when taken as conjoining "stilling" the
construction to be understood is "with the fading away and, what is more, with
the stilling, of happiness." With this construction "fading away" has the
meaning of distaste; so the meaning can be regarded as "with distaste for, and
with the stilling of, happiness." But when taken as conjoining the words "stilling
of applied and sustained thought," then the construction to be understood is
"with the fading of happiness and, further, with the stilling of applied and
sustained thought." With this construction "fading away" has the meaning of
surmounting; so this meaning can be regarded as "with the surmounting of
happiness and with the stilling of applied and sustained thought."
155. Of course, applied and sustained thought have already been stilled in the
second jhana, too. However, this is said in order to show the path to this third
jhana and in order to recommend it. For when "with the stilling of applied and
sustained thought" is said, it is declared that the path to this jhana is necessarily
by the stilling of applied and sustained thought. And just as, although mistaken
view of individuality etc., are not abandoned in the attaining of the third noble
path [but in the first], yet when it is recommended by describing their
44. Sampindana—"conjunction": gram, term for the word ca (and). This meaning not
given in PED. Cf. M-a 140.

abandonment thus, "With the abandoning of the five lower fetters" (A I 232),
[160] then it awakens eagerness in those trving to attain that third noble path—
so too, when the stilling of applied and sustained thought is mentioned, though
they are not actually stilled here [but in the second], this is a recommendation.
Hence the meaning expressed is this: "With the surmountin|g of happiness and
with the stilling of applied and sustained thought."
156. He dwells in equanimity: it watches [things] as they arise (UPApattito
IKKHATI), thus it is equanimity (upekkha—or onlooking); it sees fairly sees without
partiality (a-pakkha-patita), is the meaning. A possessor of the third jhana is said
to "dwell in equanimity" since he possesses equanimity that is clear, abundant
and sound.
Equanimity is of ten kinds; six-factored equanimity equanimity as a divine
abiding, equanimity as an enlightenment factor, equanimity of energy,
equanimity about formations, equanimity as a feeling, equanimity about insight,
equanimity as specific neutrality, equanimity of jhana and equanimity of
purification.
157.	Herein, six factored equanimity is a name for the equanimity in one whose
cankers are destroyed. It is the mode of non-abandonment of the natural state of
purity when desirable or undesirable objects of the six kinds come into focus in
the six doors described thus: "Here a bhikkhu whose cankers are destroyed is
neither glad nor sad on seeing a visible object with the eye: he dwells in
equanimity mindful and fully aware" (A III 279).
158.	Equanimity as a divine abiding is a name for equanimity consisting in the
mode of neutrality towards beings described thus: "He dwells intent upon one
quarter with his heart endued with equanimity" (D I 251).
159.	Equanimity as an enlightenment factor is a name for equanimity consisting
in the mode of neutrality in conascent states described thus: "He develops the
equanimity enlightenment factor depending on relinquishment" (M I 11).
160.	Equanimity of energy is a name for the equanimity otherwise known as
neither over-strenuous nor over-lax energy described thus: "From time to time he
------------------------------—* ------’ ——-----------— -----
brings to mind the sign of equanimity" (A I 257).
161. Equanimity about formations is a name for equanimity consisting in
neutrality about apprehending reflexion and composure regarding the
hindrances, etc., described thus: "How many kinds of equanimity about
formations arise through concentration? How many kinds of equanimity about
formations arise through insight? Eight kinds of equanimity about formations
arise through concentration. Ten kinds of equanimity ab|out formations arise
through insight"45 (Patis I 64). [161]
45. The "eight kinds" are those connected with the eight jhanas, the "ten kinds"
those connected with the four paths, the four fruitions, the void liberation, and the
signless liberation.

The Earth Kasina
162.	Equanimity as a feeling is a name for the equanimity known as neither-
pain-nor-pleasure described thus: "On the occasion on which a sense-sphere
profitable consciousness has arisen accompanied by equanimity" (Dhs §156).
163.	Equanimity about insight is a name for equanimity consisting in neutrality
about investigation described thus: "What exists, what has become, that he
abandons, and he obtains equanimity" (M II 264-65, A IV 70f).
164.	Equanimity as specific neutrality is a name for equanimity consisting in the
equal efficiency of conascent states; it is contained among the "or-whatever
states" beginning with zeal (XIV133; Dhs-a 132).
165.	Equanimity of jhana is a name for equanimity producing impartiality
towards even the highest bliss described thus: "He dwells in equanimity"
(Vibh 245).
166.	Purifying equanimity is a name for equanimity purified of all opposition,
and so consisting in uninterestedness in stilling opposition described thus:
"The fourth jhana, which ... has mindfulness purified by equanimity" (Vibh 245).
167.	Herein, six-factored equanimity, equanimity as a divine abiding,
equanimity as an enlightenment factor, equanimity as specific neutrality
equanimity of jhana and purifying equanimity are one in meaning, that is,
equanimity as specific neutrality Their difference, however, is one| of position,46
like the difference in a single being as a boy, a youth, an adult, a general, a king,
and so on. Therefore of these it should be understood that equanimity as an
enlightenment factor, etc., are not found where there is six-factored equanimity;
or that six-factored equanimity etc., are not found where there is equanimity as
an enlightenment factor.
And just as these have one meaning, so also equanimity about formations
and equanimity about insight have one meaning too; for they are simply
understanding classed in these two ways according to function.
168.	Just as, when a man has seen a snake go into his house in the evening and
has hunted for it with a forked stick, and then when he has seen it lying in the
grain store and has looked to discover whether it is actually a snake or not, and
then by seeing three marks47 has no more doubt, and so there is neutrality in him
about further investigating whether or not it is a snake, [162] so too, when a man
has begun insight, and he sees with insight knowledge the three characteristics,
then there is neutrality in him about further investigating the impermanence,
etc., of formations, and that neutrality is called equanimity about insight.
169. But just as, when the man has caught hold of the snake securely with the
forked stick and thinks, "How shall I get rid of the snake without hurting it or
getting bitten by it?" then as he is seeking only the way to get rid of it, there is
neutrality in him about the catching hold of it, so too, when a man, through
seeking the three characteristics, sees the three kinds of becoming as if burning,
46.	Avattha—"position, occasion." Not in PED; see CPD.
47.	Sovatthika-ttaya—"three marks;" cf. XXI.49.
`154
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
then there is neutrality in him about catching hold of formations, and that
neutrality is called equanimity about formations.
170.	So when equanimity about insight is established, equanimity about
formations is established too. But it is divided into two in this way according to
function, in other words, according to neutrality about investigating and about
catching hold.
Equanimity of energy and equanimity as feeling are different both from each
other and from the rest.
171.	So, of these kinds of equanimity it is equanimity of jhana that is intended
here. That has the characteristic of neutrality. Its function is to be unconcerned.
It is manifested as uninterestedness. Its proximate cause is the fading away of
happiness.
Here it may be said: Is this not simply equanimity as specific neutrality in the
meaning? And that exists in the first and second jhanas as well; so this clause,
"He dwells in equanimity" ought to be stated of those also. Why is it not?—[It
may be replied:] Because its function is unevident there since it is overshadowed
by applied thought and the rest. But it appears here with a quite evident function,
with head erect, as it were, because it is not overshadowed by applied thought
and sustained thought and happiness. That is why it is stated here.
The commentary on the meaning of the clause "He dwells in equanimity" is
thus completed in all its aspects.
172.	Now, as to mindful and fully aware: here, he remembers (sarati), thus he is
mindful (sata). He has full awareness (sampajdndti), thus he is fully aware
(sampajdna). This is mindfulness and full awareness stated as personal attributes.
Herein, mindfulness has the characteristic of remembering. Its function is not to
forget. It is manifested as guarding. Full awareness has the characteristic of
non-confusion. Its function is to investigate (judge). It is manifested as scrutiny.
173.	Herein, although this mindfulness and this full awareness exist in the
earlier jhanas as well—for one who is forgetful and not fully aware does not
attain even access, let alone absorption—yet, because of the [comparative]
grossness of those jhanas, the mind's going is easy [there], like that of a man on
[level] ground, and so the functions of mindfulness and full awareness are not
evident in them. [163] But it is only stated here because the subtlety of this jhana,
which is due to the abandoning of the gross factors, requires that the mind's
going always includes the functions of mindfulness and full awareness, like
that of a man on a razor's edge.
174. What is more, just as a calf that follows a cow returns to the cow when
taken away from her if not prevented, so too, when this third jhana is led away
from happiness, it would return to happiness if not prevented by mindfulness
and full awareness, and would rejoin happiness. And besides, beings are greedy
for bliss, and this kind of bliss is exceedingly sweet since there is none greater.
But here there is non-greed for the bliss owing to the influence of the mindfulness
and full awareness, not for any other reason. And so it should also be understood
that it is stated only here in order to emphasize this meaning too.
`155
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
175.	Now, as to the clause he feels bliss with his body: here, although in one
actually possessed of the third jhana there is no concern about feeling bliss,
nevertheless he would feel the bliss associated with his mental body, and after
emerging from the jhana he would also feel bliss since his material body would
have been affected by the exceedingly superior matter originated by that bliss
associated with the mental body48 It is in order to point to this meaning that the
words "he feels bliss with his body" are said.
176.	Now, as to the clause, that... on account of which the Noble Ones announce:
He dwells in bliss who has equanimity and is mindful: here it is the jhana, on
account of which as cause, on account of which as reason, the Noble Ones, that
is to say the Enlightened Ones, etc., "announce, teach, declare, establish, reveal,
expound, explain, clarify" (Vibh 259) that person who possesses the third
jhana—they praise, is what is intended. Why? Because "he dwells in bliss who
has equanimity and is mindful. He enters upon and dwells in that third jhana"
(tain ... tatiyam jhdnam upasampajja viharati) is how the construction should be
understood here. But why do they praise him thus? Because he is worthy of
praise.
177.	For this man is worthy of praise since he has equanimity towards the
third jhana though it possesses exceedingly sweet bliss and has reached the
perfection of bliss, and he is not drawn towards it by a liking for the bliss, and he
is mindful with the mindfulness established in order to prevent the arising of
happiness, and he feels with his mental body the undefiled bliss beloved of
Noble Ones, cultivated by Noble Ones. Because he is worthy of praise in this way
it should be understood, Noble Ones praise him with the words, "He dwells in
bliss who has equanimity and is mindful," thus declaring the special qualities
that are worthy of praise.
[164] Third: it is the third in the numerical series; and it is third because it is
entered upon third.
178.	Then it was said, which abandons one factor, possesses two factors (§153):
here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning
of happiness. But that is abandoned only at the moment of absorption, as applied
thought and sustained thought are at that of the second jhana; hence it is called
its factor of abandoning.
179. The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of
the two, namely bliss and unification. So when it is said in the Vibhanga, "'Jhana':
equanimity mindfulness, full awareness, bliss, unification of mind" (Vibh 260),
this is said figuratively in order to show that jhana with its equipment. But,
excepting the equanimity and mindfulness and full awareness, this jhana has
literally only two factors qua factors that have attained to the characteristic of
lighting (see §119), according as it is said, "What is the jhana of two factors on
that occasion? It is bliss and unification of mind" (Vibh 264).
The rest is as in the case of the first jhana.
48. For consciousness-originated materiality see XX.30 ft.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
180.	Once this has been obtained in this way, and once he has mastery in the
five ways already described, then on emerging from the now familiar third
jhana, he can regard the flaws in it thus: "This attainment is threatened by the
nearness of happiness; 'Whatever there is in it of mental concern about bliss
proclaims its grossness' (D I 37; see Ch. IX, n. 20), and its factors are weakened
by the grossness of the bliss so| expressed." He can bring the fourth jhana to
mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the third jhana and set about
doing what is needed for attaining the fourth.
181.	When he has emerged from the third jhana, the bliss, in other words, the
mental joy, appears gross to him as he reviews the jhana factors with mindfulness
and full awareness, while the equanimity as feeling and the unification of mind
appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign to mind as "earth, earth"
again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor and obtaining
the peaceful factors, [knowing] "now the fourth jhana will arise," there arises in
him mind-door adverting with that same earth kasina as its object, interrupting
the life-continuum. After that either four or five impulsions impel on that same
object, [165] the last one of which is an impulsion of the fine-material sphere
belonging to the fourth jhana. The rest are of the kinds already stated (§74).
182.	But there is this difference: blissful (pleasant) feeling is not a condition,
as repetition condition, for neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, and [the
preliminary work] must be aroused in the case of the fourth jhana with neither-
painful-nor-pleasant feeling; consequently these [consciousnesses of the
preliminary work] are associated with neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, and
here happiness vanishes simply] owing to their association with equanimity.
[The Fourth Jhana]
183.	And at this point, "With the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with
the previous disappearance of joy and grief he enters upon and dwells in the
fourth jhana, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and has purity of mindfulness
due to equanimity" (Vibh 245), and so he has attained the fourth jhana, which
abandons one factor, possesses two factors, is good in three ways, possesses ten
characteristics, and is of the earth kasina.
184.	Herein, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain: with the abandoning of
bodily pleasure and bodily pain. With the previous: which took place before, not
in the moment of the fourth jhana. Disappearance of joy and grief: with the previous
disappearance of the two, that is, mental bliss (pleasure) and mental pain; with
the abandoning, is what is meant.
185.	But when does the abandoning of these take place? At the moment of
access of the four jhanas. For [mental] joy is only abandoned at the moment of
the fourth-jhana access, while [bodily] pain, [mental] grief, and [bodily] bliss
(pleasure) are abandoned respectively at the moments of access of the first, second,
and third jhanas. So although the order in which they are abandoned is not
actually mentioned, nevertheless the abandoning of the pleasure, pain, joy and
grief, is stated here according to the order in which the faculties are summarized
in the Indriya Vibhanga (Vibh 122).
`157
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
186. But if these are only abandoned at the moments of access of the several
jhanas, why is their cessation said to. take place in the jhana itself in the following
passage: "And where does the arisen pain faculty cease without remainder?
Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable
things, a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in the first jhana, which is ... born of
seclusion. It is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder ...
Where does the arisen grief faculty [cease without remainder? ... in the second
jhana] ... Where does the arisen pleasure faculty [cease without remainder? ...
in the third jhana] ... Where does the arisen joy faculty cease without remainder?
[166] Here, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain [and with the
previous disappearance of joy and grief] a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells in
the fourth jhana, which ... has mindfulness purified by equanimity. It is here
that the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder" (S V 213-15).
J 7-7--------v-	'
It is said in that wav there referring to reinforced cessation. For in the first
jhana, etc., it is their reinforced cessation, not just their cessation, that takes
place. At the moment of access it is just their cessation, not their reinforced
cessation, that takes place.
187. For accordingly, during the first jhana access, which has multiple
adverting, there could be rearising of the [bodily] pain faculty49 due to contact
with gadflies, flies, etc. or the discomfort of an uneven seat, though that pain
faculty had already ceased, but not so duijing absorption. Or else, though it has
ceased during access, it has not absolutely ceased there since it is not quite
beaten out by opposition. But during absorption the whole body is showered
with bliss owing to pervasion by happiness. And the pain faculty has absolutely
ceased in one whose body is showered with bliss, since it is beaten out then by
opposition.
49. "They say that with the words, There could be the arising of the pain faculty' it
is shown that since grief arises even in obtainers of jhana, it is demonstrated thereby
that hate can exist without being a hindrance just as greed can; for grief does not arise
without hate. Nor, they say, is there any conflict with the Pattliana text to be fancied
here, since what is shown there is only grief that occurs making lost jhana its object
because the grief that occurs making its object a jhana that has not been lost is not
relevant there. And they say that it cannot be maintained that grief does not arise at all
in those who have obtained jhana since it did arise in Asita who had the eight attainments
(Sn 691), and he was not one who had lost jhana. So they say. That is wrong because
there is no hate without the nature of a hindrance. If there were, it would arise in fine-
material and immaterial beings, and it does not. Accordingly when in such passages
as, 'In the immaterial state, due to the hindrance of lust there is the hindrance of
stiffness and torpor ... the hindrance of agitation, the hindrance of ignorance' (Patth II
291), ill will and worry are not mentioned as hindrances, that does not imply that they
are not hindrances even by supposing that it was because lust, etc., were not actually
hindrances and were called hindrances there figuratively because of resemblance to
hindrances. And it is no reason to argue, 'it is because it arose in Asita/ since there is
falling away from jhana with the arising of grief. The way to regard that is that when
the jhana is lost for some trivial reason such men reinstate it without difficulty"
(Vism-mht 158-59).
`158
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
188.	And during the second-jhana access too, which has multiple advertings,
there could be rearising of the [mental] grief faculty, although it had already
ceased there, because it arises when there is bodily weariness and mental
vexation, which have applied thought and sustained thought as their condition,
but it does not arise when applied and sustained thought are absent. When it
arises, it does so in the presence of applied and sustained thought, and they are
not abandoned in the second-jhana access; but thjis is not so in the second jhana
itself because its conditions are abandoned there.
189.	Likewise in the third-jhana access there could be rearising of the
abandoned [bodily] pleasure faculty in one whose body was pervaded by the
superior materiality originated by the [consciousness associated with the]
happiness. But not so in the third jhana itself. For in the third jhana the happiness
that is a condition for the [bodily] bliss (pleasure) has ceased entirely. Likewise
in the fourth-jhana access there could be re-arising of the abandoned [mental]
joy faculty because of its nearness and because it has not been properly
surmounted owing to the absence of equanimity brought to absorption strength.
But not so in the fourth jhana itself. And that is why in each case (§186) the
words "without remainder" are included thus: "It is here that the arisen pain
faculty ceases without remainder."
190. Here it may be asked: Then if these kinds of feeling are abandoned in the
access in this way why are they brought in here? It is done so that they can be
readily grasped. For the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling described here by
the words "which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure" is subtle, hard to recognize
and not readily grasped. So just as, when a cattle-h|erd50 wants to catch a refractory
ox that cannot be caught at all by approaching it, he collects all the cattle into
one pen [167] and lets them out one by one, and then [he says] "That is it; catch
it," and so it gets caught as well, so too the Blessed One has collected all these
[five kinds of feeling] together so that they can be grasped readily; for when they
are shown collected together in this way then what is not [bodily] pleasure
(bliss) or [bodily] pain or [mental] joy or [mental] grief can still be grasped in
this way: "This is neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."
191.	Besides, this may be understood as said in order to show the condition for
the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance. For the abandoning of
[bodily] pain, etc., are conditions for that, according as it is said: "There are four
conditions, friend, for the attainment of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-
deliverance. Here, friend, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain and with
the previous disappearance of jov and grief a bhikkhu enters upon and dwells
in the fourth jhana ... equanimity. These are the four conditions for the attainment
of the neither-painful-nor-pleasant mind-deliverance" (M I 296).
192.	Or alternatively just as, although mistaken view of individuality etc.,
have already been abandoned in the earlier paths, they are nevertheless
mentioned as abandoned in the description of the third path for the purpose
of recommending it (cf. §155), so too these kinds of feeling can be understood
50. Goya—"cowherd (or guardian)": not in PED.
`159
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
as mentioned here for the purpose of recommending this jhana. Or
alternatively, they can be understood as mentioned for the purpose of showing
that greed and hate are very far away owing to the removal of their conditions;
for of these, pleasure (bliss) is a condition for joy, and joy for greed; pain is a
condition for grief and grief for hate. So with the removal of pleasure (bliss),
etc., greed and hate are very far away since they are removed along with their
conditions.
193. Which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure: no pain owing to absence of pain; no
pleasure owing to absence of pleasure (bliss). Bv this he indicates the third kind
of feeling that is in opposition both to pain and to pleasure, not the mere absence
of pain and pleasure. This third kind of feeling named neither-pain-nor-pleasure
is also called "equanimity." It has the characteristic of experiencing what is
contrary to both the desirable and the undesirable. Its function is neutral. Its
manifestation is unevident. Its proximate cause should be understood as the
cessation of pleasure (bliss).
194.	And has purity of mindfulness due to equanimity: has purity of mindfulness
brought about by equanimity For the mindfulness in this jhana is quite purified,
and its purification is effected by equanimity not by anything else. That is why
it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity Also it is said in the
Vibhanga: "This mindfulness is cleared, purified, clarified, by equanimity; hence
it is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity" (Vibh 261). [168] And
the equanimity due to which there comes to be this purity of mindfulness should
be understood as specific neutrality in meaning. And not only mindfulness is
purified by it here, but also all associated states. However, the teaching is given
under the heading of mindfulness.
195.	Herein, this equanimity exists i|n the three lower jhanas too; but just as,
although a crescent moon exists by day but is not purified or clear since it is
outshone by the sun's radiance in the daytime or since it is deprived of the
night, which is its ally owing to gentleness and owing to helpfulness to it, so
too, this crescent moon of equanimity consisting in specific neutrality exists in
the first jhana, etc., but it is not purified since it is outshone by the glare of the
opposing states consisting in applied thought, etc., and since it is deprived of
the night of equanimity-as-feeling for its allv; and because it is not purified, the
conascent mindfulness and other states are not purified either, like the unpurified
crescent moon's radiance by day That is why no one among these [first three
jhanas] is said to have purity of mindfulness due to equanimity But here this
crescent moon consisting in specific neutrality is utterly pure because it is
not outshone by the glare of the opposing states consisting in applied
thought, etc., and because it has the night of equanimity-as-feeling for its
ally. And since it is purified, the conascent mindfulness and other states are
purified and clear also, like the purified crescent moon's radiance. That, it
should be understood, is whv only this jhana is said to have purity of
mindfulness due to equanimity.
196. Fourth: it is fourth in numerical series; and it is fourth because it is entered
upon fourth.
`160
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
197.	Then it was said, which abandons one factor, possesses two factors (§183);
here the abandoning of the one factor should be understood as the abandoning
of joy. But that joy is actually abandoned in the first impulsions of the same
cognitive series (cf. §185). Hence it is called its factor of abandoning.
The possession of the two factors should be understood as the arising of the
two, namely equanimity as feeling and unification of mind.
The rest is as stated in the case of the first jhan|a.
This, in the first place, is according to the fourfold reckoning of jhana.
[The Fivefold Reckoning of Jhana]
198.	When, however, he is developing fivefold jhana, then, on emerging from
the now familiar first jhana, he can regard the flaws in it in this way: "This
attainment is threatened by the nearness of the hindrances, and its factors are
weakened by the grossness of applied thought." [169] He can bring the second
jhana to mind as quieter and so end his attachment to the first jhana and set
about doing what is needed for attaining the second.
199.	Now, he emerges from the first jhana mindfully and fully aware; and only
applied thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhana factors, while the
sustained thought, etc., appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign to
mind as "earth, earth" again and again with the purpose of abandoning the
gross factor and obtaining the peaceful factors, the second jhana arises in him
in the way already described.
Its factor of abandoning is applied thought only. The four beginning with
sustained thought are the factors that it possesses. The rest is as already stated.
200.	When this has been obtained in this way and once he has mastery in the
five ways already described, then on emerging from the now familiar second
jhana he can regard the flaws in it in this way: "This attainment is threatened by
the nearness of applied thought, and its factors are weakened by the grossness
of sustained thought." He can bring the third jhana to mind as quieter and so
end his attachment to the second jhana and set about doing what is needed for
attaining the third.
201.	Now, he emerges from the second jhana mindfully and fully aware; only
sustained thought appears gross to him as he reviews the jhana factors, while
happiness, etc., appear peaceful. Then, as he brings that same sign to mind as
"earth, earth" again and again with the purpose of abandoning the gross factor
and obtaining the peaceful factors, the third jhana arises in him in the way
already described.
Its factor of abandoning is sustained thought only. The three beginning with
happiness, as in the second jhana in the fourfold reckoning, are the factors that
it possesses. The rest is as already stated.
202.	So that which is the second in the fourfold reckoning becomes the second
and third in the fivefold reckoning by being divided into two. And those which
`161
Chapter IV
The Earth Kasina
are the third and fourth in the former reckoning become the fourth and fifth in
this reckoning. The first remains the first in each case.
The fourth chapter called "The Description of the Earth
Kasina" in the Treatise on the Development of Concen-
tration in the Path of Purification composed for the purpose
of gladdening good people.
`162
Chapter V
The Remaining Kasinas
(Sesa-his i\na-niddesa)
[The Water Kasina]
1.	[170] Now, the water kasina comes next after the earth kasina (III.105). Here
is the detailed explanation.
One who wants to develop the water kasina should, as in the case of the earth
kasina, seat himself comfortably and apprehend the sign in water that "is either
made up or not made up," etc.; and so all the rest should be repeated in detail
(IV22). And as in this case, so with all those that follow [in this chapter]. We
shall in fact not repeat even this much and shall only point out what is different.
2.	Here too, when someone has had practice in previous [lives], the sign arises
for him in water that is not made up, such as a pool, a lake, a lagoon, or the ocean
as in the case of the Elder Ciila-Slva. The venerable one, it seems, thought to
abandon gain and honour and live a secluded life. He boarded a ship at
Mahatittha (Mannar) and sailed to Jambudlpa (India). As he gazed at the ocean
meanwhile, the kasina sign, the counterpart of that ocean, arose in him.
3.	Someone with no such previous practice should guard against the four
faults of a kasina (IV24) and not apprehend the water as one of the colours, blue,
yellow, red or white. He should fill a bowl or a four-footed water pot1 to the brim
with water uncontaminated by soil, taken in the open through a clean cloth
[strainer], or with any other clear unturbid water. He should put it in a screened
place on the outskirts of the monastery as already described and seat himself
comfortably He should neither review its colour nor bring its characteristic to
mind. Apprehending the colour as belonging to its physical support, he should
set his mind on the [name] concept as the most outstanding mental datum, and
using any among the [various] names for water (apo) such as "rain" (ambu),
"liquid" (udaka), "dew" (vdri), "fluid" (salila),2 he should develop [the kasina] by
using [preferably] the obvious "water, water."
4. As he develops it in this way, the two signs eventually arise in him in the way
already described. Here, however, the learning sign has the appearance of moving.
[171] If the water has bubbles of froth mixed with it, the learning sign has the

`163
Chapter V
The Remaining Kasinas
same appearance, and it is evident as a fault in the kasina. But the counterpart
sign appears inactive, like a crystal fan set in space, like the disk of a looking-
glass made of crystal. With the appearance of that sign he reaches access jhana
and the jhana tetrad and pentad in the way already described.
[The Fire Kasin|a]
5. Anyone who wants to develop the fire kasina should apprehend the sign in
fire. Herein, when someone with merit, having had previous practice, is
apprehending the sign, it arises in him in any sort of fire, not made up, as he
looks at the fiery combustion in a lamp's flame or in a furnace or in a place for
baking bowls or in a forest conflagration, as in the Elder Cittagutta's case. The
sign arose in that elder as he was looking at a lamp's flame while he was in the
Uposatha house on the day of preaching the Dhamma.
6.	Anyone else should make one up. Here are the directions for making it. He
should split up some damp heartwood, dry it, and break it up into short lengths.
He should go to a suitable tree root or to a shed and there make a pile in the wav
done for baking bowls, and have it lit. He should make a hole a span and four
fingers wide in a rush mat or a piece of leather or a cloth, and after hanging it in
front of the fire, he should sit down in the way already described. Instead of
giving attention to the grass and sticks below or the smoke above, he should
apprehend the sign in the dense combustion in the middle.
7.	He should not review the colour as blue or yellow, etc., or give attention to its
characteristic as heat, etc., but taking the colour as belonging to its physical
support, and setting his mind on the [name] concept as the most outstanding
mental datum, and using any [among the names for fire (tejo) such as "the Bright
One" (yavaka), "the Leaver of the Black Trail" (kanhavattani), "the Knower of
Creatures" (jataveda), "the Altar of Sacrifice" (hutasana), etc., he should develop
[the kasina] by using [preferably] the obvious "fire, fire."
8.	As he develops it in this way the two signs eventually arise in him as already
described. Herein, the learning sign appears like [the fire to keep] sinking down
as the flame keeps detaching itself. [172] But when someone apprehends it in a
kasina that is not made up, any fault in the kasina is evident [in the learning
sign], and any firebrand, or pile of embers or ashes, or smoke appears in it. The
counterpart sign appears motionless like a piece of red cloth set in space, like a
gold fan, like a gold column. With its appearance he reaches access jhana and
the jhana tetrad and pentad in the way already described.
[The Air Kasina]
9. Anyone who wants to develop the air kasina should apprehend the sign in
air. And that is done either by sight or by touch. For this is said in the
Commentaries: "One who is learning the air kasina apprehends the sign in air.
He notices the tops of [growing] [sugarcane moving to and fro; or he notices the
tops of bamboos, or the tops of trees, or the ends of the hair, moving to and fro; or
he notices the touch of it on the body."
`164
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
10.	So when he sees sugarcanes with dense foliage standing with tops level or
bamboos or trees, or else hair four fingers long on a man's head, being struck by
the wind, he should establish mindfulness in this way: "This wind is striking
on this place." Or he can establish mindfulness where the wind strikes a part of
his body after entering by a window opening or by) a crack in a wall, and using
any among the names for wind (vdta) beginning with "wind" (vata), "breeze"
(:rnaluta), "blowing" (anila), he should develop [the kasina] by using [preferably]
the obvious "air, air."
11.	Here the learning sign appears to move like the swirl of hot [steam] on rice
gruel just withdrawn from an oven. The counterpart sign is quiet and motionless.
The rest should be understood in the way already described.
[The Blue Kasina]
12.	Next it is said [in the Commentaries]: "One who is learning the blue kasina
apprehends the sign in blue, whether in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour
element."3 Firstly, when someone has merit, having had previous practice, the
sign arises in him when he sees a bush with blue flowers, or such flowers spread
out on a place of offering, or any blue cloth or gem.
13.	[173] But anyone else should take flowers such as blue lotuses, girikannikd
(morning glory) flowers, etc., and spread them out to fill a tray or a flat basket
completely so that no stamen or stalk shows or with only their petals. Or he can
fill it with blue cloth bunched up together; or he can fasten the cloth over the rim
of the tray or basket like the covering of a drum. Or he can make a kasina disk,
either portable as described under the earth kasina or on a wall, with one of the
colour elements such as bronze-green, leaf-green, anjana-ointment black,
surrounding it with a different colour. After that, he should bring it to mind as
"blue, blue" in the way already described under the earth kasina.
14.	And here too any fault in the kasina is evident in the learning sign; the
stamens and stalks and the gaps between the petals, etc., are apparent. The
counterpart sign appears like a crystal fan in space, free from the kasina disk.
The rest should be understood as already described.
[The Yellow Kasina]
15. Likewise with the yellow kasina; for this is said: "One who is learning the
yellow kasina apprehends the sign in yellow, either in a flower or in a cloth or in
a colour element." Therefore here too, when someone has merit, having had
previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush or
flowers spread out, or yellow cloth or colour element, as in the case of the Elder
Cittagutta. That venerable one, it seems, saw an offering being made on the
flower altar, with pattanga flowers4 at Cittalapabbata, and as soon as he saw it the
sign arose in him the size of the flower altar.
3.	Vanna-dhatu—"colour element" should perhaps have been rendered simply by
"paint." The one Pali word “nila” has to serve for the English blue, green, and sometimes
black.
4.	Pattanga: not in PED. Asana—"altar": not in this sense in PED
`165
Chapter V
The Remaining Kasinas
16.	Anyone else should make a kasina, in the wav described for the blue kasina,
with kanikdra flowers, etc., or with yellow cloth or with a colour element. He
should bring it to mind as "yellow, yellow." The rest is as before.
[The Red Kasina]
17.	Likewise with the red kasina; for this is said: "One who is learning the red
kasina apprehends the sign in red, [174] either in a flower or in a cloth or in a
colour element." Therefore here too, when someone has merit, having had
previous practice, the sign arises in him when he sees a bandhujwaka (hibiscus)
bush, etc., in flower, or such flowers spread out, or a red cloth or gem or colour
element.
18.	But anyone else should make a kasina, in the way already described for the
blue kasina, with jayasumana flowers or bandhujwaka or red korandaka flowers,
etc., or with red cloth or with a colour element. He should bring it to mind as
"red, red." The rest is as before.
[The White Kasina]
19.	Of the white kasina it is said: "One who is learning the white kasina
apprehends the sign in white, either in a flower or in a cloth or in a colour
element." So firstly, when someone has merit, having had previous practice, the
sign arises in him when he sees a flowering bush of such a kind or vassikasumana
(jasmine) flowers, etc., spread out, or a heap of white lotuses or lilies, white cloth
or colour element; and it also arises in a tin disk, a silver disk, and the moon's
disk.
20.	Anyone else should make a kasina, in the way already described for the
blue kasina, with the white flowers already mentioned, or with cloth or colour
element. He should bring it to mind as "white, white." The rest is as before.
[The Light Kasina]
21.	Of the light kasina it is said: "One who is learning the light kasina
OI—	--------o	o	•
apprehends the sign in light in a hole in a wall, or in a keyhole, or in a window
opening." So firstly, when someone has merit, having had previous practice, the
sign arises in him when he sees the circle thrown on a wall or a floor by sunlight
or moonlight entering through a hole in a wall, etc., or when he sees a circle
thrown on the ground bv sunlight or moonlight coming through a gap in the
branches of a dense-leaved tree or through a gap in a hut made of closely packed
branches.
22.	Anyone else should use that same kind of circle of luminosity just described,
developing it as "luminosity luminosity" or "light, light." If he cannot do so, he
can light a lamp inside a pot, close the pot's mouth, make a hole in it| and place
it with the hole facing a wall. The lamplight coming out of the hole throws a
circle on the wall. He should develop that [175] as "light, light." This lasts
longer than the other kinds.
23.	Here the learning sign is like the circle thrown on the wall or the ground. The
counterpart sign is like a compact bright cluster of lights. The rest is as before.
`166
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[The Limited-Space Kasina]
24.	Of the limited-space kasina it is said: "One who is learning the space
kasina apprehends the sign in a hole in a wall, or in a keyhole, or in a window
opening." So firstly when someone has merit, having had previous practice, the
sign arises in him when he sees any [such gap as a] hole in a wall.
25.	Anyone else should make a hole a span and four fingers broad in a well-
thatched hut, or in a piece of leatheij, or in a rush mat, and so on. He should
develop one of these, or a hole such as a hole in a wall, as "space, space."
26.	Here the learning sign resembles the hole together with the wall, etc., that
surrounds it. Attempts to extend it fail. The counterpart sign appears only as a
circle of space. Attempts to extend it succeed. The rest should be understood as
described under the earth kasina.5
[General]
27.	He with Ten Powers, who all things did see,
Tells ten kasinas, each of which can be
The cause of fourfold and of fivefold jhana,
The fine-material sphere's own master key.
Now, knowing their descriptions and the way
To tackle each and how they are developed,
There are some further points that will repay
Study each with its special part to play.
28.	Of these, the earth kasina is the basis for such powers as the state described
as "Having been one, he becomes many" (D I 78), etc., and stepping or standing
or sitting on space or on water bv creating earth), and the acquisition of the bases
of mastery (M II 13) bv the limited and measureless method.
29.	The water kasina is the basis for such powers as diving in and out of the
earth (D I 78), causing rain, storms, creating rivers and seas, making the earth
and rocks and palaces quake (M I 253).
--
5. In the Suttas the first eight kasinas are the same as those given here, and they are
the onlv ones mentioned in the DhammasanganI (§160-203) and Patisambhida (Patis
16). The Suttas give space and consciousness as ninth and tenth respectively (MII14-
15; D III 268; Netti 89, etc.). But these last two appear to coincide with the first two
immaterial states, that is, boundless space and boundless consciousness. The light
kasina given here as ninth does not appear in the Suttas. It is perhaps a development
from the "perception of light" (dloka-sanna) (A II 45). The limited-space kasina given
here as tenth has perhaps been made "limited' in order to differentiate it from the first
immaterial state. The commentary on the consciousness kasina (M-a III 261) says
nothing on this aspect. As to space, Vism-mht (p. 373) says: "The attainment of the
immaterial states is not produced by means of the space kasina, and with the words
'ending with the white kasina' (XXI.2) the light kasina is included in the white kasina."
For description of space (<dkasa) see Dhs-a 325, Netti 29. Also Vism-mht (p. 393) defines
space thus: "Wherever there is no obstruction, that is called space." Again the Majjhima
Nikdya Tlkd (commenting on MN106) remarks: "[Sense desires] are not called empty (ritta)
in the sense that space, which is entirely devoid of individual essence, is called empty"
`167
Chapter V
The Remaining Kasinas
30.	The fire kasina is the basis for such powers as smoking, flaming, causing
showers of sparks, countering fire with fire, ability to burn only what one wants
to burn (S IV 290), [176] causing light for the purpose of seeing visible objects
with the divine eye, burning up the body by means of the fire element at the time
of attaining Nibbana (M-a IV 196).
31.	The air kasina is the basis for such powers as going with the speed of the
wind, causing wind storms.
32.	The blue kasina is the basis for such powers as creating black forms, causing
darkness, acquisition of the bases of mastery by the method of fairness and
ugliness, and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful (see M II 12)
33.	The yellow kasina is the basis for such powers as creating yellow forms,
resolving that something shall be gold (S I 116), acquisition of the bases of
mastery in the wav stated, and attainment of the liberation by the beautiful.
34.	The red kasina is the basis for such powers as creating red forms, acquisition
of the bases of mastery in the way stated, and attainment of the liberation by the
beautiful.
35.	The white kasina is the basis for such powers as creating white forms,
banishing stiffness and torpor, dispelling darkness, causing light for the purpose
of seeing visible objects with the |divine eye.
36.	The light kasina is the basis for such powers as creating luminous forms,
banishing stiffness and torpor, dispelling darkness, causing light for the purpose
of seeing visible objects with the divine eye.
37.	The space kasina is the basis for such powers as revealing the hidden,
maintaining postures inside the earth and rocks by creating space inside them,
travelling unobstructed through walls, and so on.
38.	The classification "above, below, around, exclusive, measureless" applies
to all kasinas; for this is said: "He perceives the earth kasina above, below, around,
exclusive, measureless" (M II 14), and so on.
39.	Herein, above is upwards towards the sky's level. Below is downwards
towards the earth's level. Around is marked off all around like the perimeter of a
field. For one extends a kasina upwards only another downwards, another all
round; or for some reason another projects it thus as one who wants to see
visible objects with the divine eye projects light. [177] Hence "above, below,
around" is said. The word exclusive, however, shows that anyone such state has
nothing to do with any other. Just as there is water and nothing else in all
directions for one who is actually in water, so too, the earth kasina is the earth
kasina onlv; it has nothing in common with any other kasina. Similarly in each
instance. Measureless means measureless intentness. He is intent upon the
entirety with his mind, taking no measurements in this way: "This is its
beginning, this is its middle."
40. No kasina can be developed by any living being described as follows:
"Beings hindered by kamma, by defilement or bv kamma-result, who lack faith,
zeal and understanding, will be incapable of entering into the certainty of
rightness in profitable states" (Vibh 341).
`168
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
41.	Herein, the words hindered by kamma refer to those who possess bad kamma
entailing immediate effect [on rebirth].6 By defilement: who have fixed wrong
view7 or are hermaphrodites or eunuchs. By kamma-result: who have had a rebirth-
linking with no [profitable] root-cause or with only two [profitable] root-causes.
Lack faith: are destitute of faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. Zeal: are
destitute of zeal for the unopposed way. Understanding: are destitute of mundane
and supramundane right view. Will be incapable of entering into the certainty of
rightness in profitable states means that they are incapable of entering into the
noble path called "certainty" and "rightness in profitable states."
42.	And this does not apply only to kasinas; for none of them will succeed in
developing any meditation subject at all. So the task of devotion to a meditation
subject must be undertaken by a clansman who has no hindrance by kamma-
result, who shuns hindrance by kamma and by defilement, and who fosters
faith, zeal and understanding by listening to the Dhamma, frequenting good
men, and so on.
The fifth chapter called "The Description of the
Remaining Kasinas" in the Treatise on the Development
of Concentration in the Path of Purification composed
for the purpose of gladdening good people.
--
6.	The five kinds of bad kamma with immediate effect on rebirth are, in that order of
priority: matricide, parricide, arahanticide, intentional shedding of a Buddha's blood,
and causing a schism in the Community all of which cause rebirth in hell and remaining
there for the remainder of the aeon (kappa), whatever other kinds of kamma mav have
been performed (M-a IV 109f.).
7.	The no-cause view, moral-inefficacy-of-action view, the nihilistic view that there is
no such thing as giving, and so on (see DN 2).

Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
(Astibha-kammatthana-niddesa)
[General Definitions]
1.	[178] Now, ten kinds of foulness, [as corpses] without consciousness, were
listed next after the kasinas thus: the bloated, the livid, the festering, the cut up,
the gnawed, the scattered, the hacked and scattered, the bleeding, the worm
infested, a skeleton (III.105).
The bloated: it is bloated (uddhumata) because bloated by gradual dilation and
swelling after (uddham) the close of life, as a bellows is with wind. What is
bloated (uddhumata) is the same as "the bloated" (uddhumataka). Or alternatively
what is bloated (uddhnmata) is vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the bloated" (uddhumataka). This is a term for a corpse in that particular state.
2.	The livid: what has patchy discolouration is called livid (vinlla). What is
livid is the same as "the livid" (vinllaka). Or alternatively what is livid (vinlla) is
vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is "the livid" (vinllaka)} This is a
term for a corpse that is reddish-coloured in places where flesh is prominent,
whitish-coloured in places where pus has collected, but mostly blue-black (nlla),
as if draped with blue-black cloth in the blue-black places.
3.	The festering: what is trickling with pus in broken places is festering (vipubba).
What is festering is the same as "the festering" (vipubbaka). Or alternatively,
what is festering (vipubba) is vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the festering" (vipubbaka). This is a term for a corpse in that particular state.
4.	The cut up: what has been opened up2 by cutting it in two is called cut up
(vicchidda). What is cut up is the same as "the cut up" (vicchiddaka). Or alternatively
what is cut up (vicchidda) is vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the cut up" (vicchiddaka). This is a term for a corpse cut in the middle. [179]
5.	The gnawed: what has been chewed here and there in various ways by dogs,
jackals, etc., is what is gnawed (vikkhayita). What is gnawed is the same as "the
gnawed" (vikkhayitaka). Or alternatively what is gnawed (vikkhayita) is vile
1.	It is not possible to render such associative and alliterative derivations of meaning
into English. They have nothing to do w|ith the historical development of words, and
their purpose is purely mnemonic.
2.	Apavarita—"opened up": not in PED.
`170
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
(kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is "the gnawed" (vikkhayitaka). This
is a term for a corpse in that particular state.
6.	The scattered: what is strewed about (vividham khittam) is scattered (vikkhittam).
What is scattered is the same as "the scattered" (vikkhittaka). Or alternatively,
what is scattered (vikkhitta) is vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is
"the scattered" (vikkhittaka). This is a term for a corpse that is strewed here and
there in this way: "Here a hand, there a foot, there the head" (cf. M I 58).
7.	The hacked and scattered: it is hacked, and it is scattered in the way just
described, thus it is "hacked and scattered" (hata-vikkhittaka). This is a term for
a corpse scattered in the way just described after it has been hacked with a knife
in a crow's-foot pattern on everv limb.
8.	The bleeding: it sprinkles (kirati), scatters, blood (lohita), and it trickles here
and there, thus it is "the bleeding" (lohitaka). This is a term for a corpse smeared
with trickling blood.
9.	The worm-infested: it is maggots that are called worms (puluva); it sprinkles
worms (puluve kirati), thus it is worm-infested (puluvaka). This is a term for a
corpse full of maggots.
10.	A skeleton: bone (atthi) is the same as skeleton (atthika). Or alternatively,
bone (atthi) is vile (kucchita) because of repulsiveness, thus it is a skeleton (atthika).
This is a term both for a single bone and for a framework of bones.
11.	These names are also used both for the signs that arise with the bloated,
etc., as their support, and for the jhanas obtained in the signs.
[The Bloated]
12.	Herein, when a meditator wants to develop the jhana called "of the bloated"
by arousing the sign of the bloated on a bloated body he should in the way
alreadv described approach a teacher of the kind mentioned under the earth
kasina and learn the meditation subject from him. In explaining the meditation
subject to him, the teacher should explain it all, that is, the directions for going
with the aim of acquiring the sign of foulness, the characterizing of the
surrounding signs, the eleven ways of apprehending the sign, the reviewing of
the path gone by and come by, concluding with the directions for absorption.
And when the meditator has learnt it all well, he should go to an abode of the
kind already described and live there while seeking the sign of the bloated.
13.	Meanwhile, when he hears people saying that at some village gate or on
some road or at some forest's edge or at the base of some rock or at the root of
some tree [180] or on some charnel ground a bloated corpse is lying, he should
not go there at once, like one who plunges into a river where there is no ford.
14.	Why not? Because this foulness is beset by wild beasts and non-human
beings, and he might risk his life there. Or perhaps the way to it goes by a village
gate or a bathing place or an irrigated field, and there a visible object of the
opposite sex might come into focus. Or perhaps the body is of the opposite sex;
for a female body is unsuitable for a man, and a male body for a woman. If only
recently dead, it may even look beautiful; hence there might be da|nger to the life
`171
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
of purity. But if he judges himjself thus, "This is not difficult for one like me,"
then he can go there.
15.	And when he goes, he should do so only after he has spoken to the senior
elder of the Community or to some well-known bhikkhu.
16.	Why? Because if all his limbs are seized with shuddering at the charnel
ground, or if his gorge rises when he is confronted with disagreeable objects
such as the visible forms and sounds of non-human beings, lions, tigers, etc., or
something else afflicts him, then he whom he told will have his bowl and robe
well looked after in the monastery, or he will care for him by sending young
bhikkhus or novices to him.
17.	Besides, robbers may meet there thinking a charnel ground a safe place for
them whether or not they have done anything wrong. And when men chase
them, they drop their goods near the bhikkhu and run away Perhaps the men
seize the bhikkhu, saying "We have found the thief with the goods," and bully
him. Then he whom he told will explain to the men "Do not bully him; he went
to do this special work after telling me," and he will rescue him. This is the
advantage of going only after informing someone.
18.	Therefore he should inform a bhikkhu of the kind described and then set
out eager to see the sign, and as happy and joyful as a warrior-noble (khattiya)
on his way to the scene of anointing, as one going to offer libations at the hall of
sacrifice, or as a pauper on his way to unearth a hidden treasure. And he should
go there in the way advised by the Commentaries.
19.	For this is said: "One who is learning the bloated sign of foulness goes
alone with no companion, with unremitting mindfulness established, with his
sense faculties turned inwards, with his mind not turned outwards, reviewing
the path gone by and come bv. In the place where the bloated sign of foulness
[181] has been left he notes any stone or termite-mound or tree or bush or creeper
there each with its particular sign and in relation to the object. When he has
done this, he characterizes the bloated sign of foulness by the fact of its having
attained that particular individual essence, (see §84) Then he sees that the sign
is properly apprehended, that it is properly remembered, that it is properly
defined, by its colour, by its mark, by its shape, by its direction, by its location, by
its delimitation, by its joints, by its openings, by its concavities, bv its convexities,
and all round.
20.	"When he has properly apprehended the sign, properly remembered it,
properly defined it, he goes alone with no companion, with unremitting
mindfulness established, with his sense faculties turned inwards, with his mind
not turned outwards, reviewing the path gone by and come by. When he walks,
he resolves that his walk is oriented towards it; when he sits, he prepares a seat
that is oriented towards it.
21.	"What is the purpose, what is the advantage of characterizing the
surrounding signs? Characterizing the surrounding signs has non-delusion
for its purpose, it has non-delusion for its advantage. What is the purpose, what
is the advantage of apprehending the sign in the [other] eleven ways?
`172
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
Apprehending the sign in the [other] eleven ways has anchoring [the mind] for
its purpose, it has anchoring [the mind] for its advantage. What is the purpose,
what is the advantage of reviewing the path gone by and come by? Reviewing
the path gone by and come by has keeping [the mind] on the track for its purpose,
it has keeping [the mind] on the track for its advantage.
22.	"When he has established reverence for it bv seeing its advantages and by
perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it, he anchors his mind upon that
object: 'Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and deatjh.' Quite
secluded from sense desires, secluded from unprofitable things he enters upon
and dwells in the first jhana ... [seclusion]. He has arrived at the first jhana of the
fine-material sphere. His is a heavenly abiding and an instance of the meritorious
action consisting in [meditative] development." (Source untraced.)
23.	So if he goes to the charnel ground to test his control of mind, let him do so
— •------t,---—............— ......— --------*— -........—............
after striking the gong or summoning a chapter. If he goes there mainly for
[developing that] meditation subject, let him go alone with no companion, without
renouncing his basic meditation subject and keeping it alwavs in mind, taking
a walking stick or a staff to keep off attacks by dogs, etc., [182] ensuring
unremitting mindfulness by establishing it well, with his mind not turned
outwards because he has ensured that his faculties, of which his mind is the
sixth, are turned inwards.
24.	As he goes out of the monastery he should note the gate: "I have gone out in
such a direction by such a gate." After that he should define the path by which he
goes: "This path goes in an easterly direction ... westerly ... northerly ... southerly
direction" or "It goes in an intermediate direction"; and "In this place it goes to the
left, in this place to the right"; and |"In this place there is a stone, in this a termite-
mound, in this a tree, in this a bush, in this a creeper." He should go to the place
where the sign is, defining in this wav the path by which he goes.
25.	And he should not approach it upwind; for if he did so and the smell of
corpses assailed his nose, his brain3 might get upset, or he might throw up his
food, or he might repent his coming, thinking "What a place of corpses I have
come to!" So instead of approaching it upwind, he should go downwind. If he
cannot go by a downwind path—if there is a mountain or a ravine or a rock or a
fence or a patch of thorns or water or a bog in the way—then he should go
stopping his nose with the corner of his robe. These are the duties in going.
26. When he has gone there in this way, he should not at once look at the sign
of foulness; he should make sure of the direction. For perhaps if he stands in a
certain direction, the object does not appear clearly to him and his mind is not
wieldy. So rather than there he should stand where the object appears clearly
and his mind is wieldy And he should avoid standing to leeward or to windward
of it. For if he stands to leeward he is bothered by the corpse smell and his mind
strays; and if he stands to windward and non-human beings are dwelling there,
3. This does not imply what we, now, might suppose. See the description of "brain"
in VIII. 126 and especially VIII. 136. What is meant is perhaps that he might get a cold
or catarrh.
`173
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
they may get annoyed and do him a mischief. So he should move round a little
and not stand too much to windward. [183]
27.	Then he should stand not too far off or too near, or too much towards the
feet or the head. For if he stands too far off, the object is not clear to him, and if he
stands too near, he may get frightened. If he stands too much towards the feet or
the head, not all the foulness becomes manifest to him equally. So he should
stand not too far off or too near, opposite the middle of the body in a place
convenient for him to look at it.
28.	Then he should characterize the surrounding signs in the way stated thus:
"In the place where the bloated sign of foulness has been left he notes any stone
... or creeper there with its sign" (§19).
29.	These are the directions for characterizing them. If there is a rock in the
eye's focus near the sign, he should define it in this way: "This rock is high or
low, small or large, brown or black or white, long or round," after which he
should observe [the relative positions] thus: "In this place, this is a rock, this is
the sign of foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this is a rock."
30.	If there is a termite-mound, he should define it in this way: "This is high or
low, small or large, brown or black or white, long or round," after which he
should observe [the relative positions] thus: "In this place, this is a termite-
mound, this is the sign of foulness."
31.	If there is a tree, he should define it in this way: "This is a pipal fig tree or
a banyan fig tree or a kacchaka fig tree or a kapittha fig tree; it is tall or short, small
or large, black or white," after which he should observe [the relative positions]
thus: "In this place, this is a tree, this is the sign of foulness."
32.	If there is a bush, he should define it in this way: "This is a sindi bush or a
karamanda bush or a kanavlra bush or a korandaka bush; it is tall or short, small or
large," after which he should observe [the relative positions] thus: "In this place,
this is a bush, this is the sign of foulness."
33.	If there is a creeper, he should define it in this way: "This is a pumpkin creeper
or a gourd creeper or a brown creeper or a black creeper or a stinking creeper," after
which he should observe [the relative positions] thus: "In this place, this is a creeper,
this is the sign of foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this is a creeper."
34.	Also with its particular sign and in relation to the object was said (§19); but
that is included by what has just been said; for he "characterizes it with its
particular sign" when he defines it again and again, and he "characterizes it in
relation to the object" when he defines it by combining it each time in pairs thus:
"This is a rock, this is the sign of foulness; this is the sign of foulness, this is a
rock."
35.	Having done this, again he should bring to mind the fact that it has an
individual essence, its own state of being bloated, which is not common to
anything else, since it was said that he defines4 it by the fact of its having attained
4. Reference back to §19 requires sabhavato upalakkhati rather than sabhavato vavatthapeti,
but so the readings have it.
`174
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
that particular individual essence. The meaning is that it should be defined
according to individual essence, according to its own nature, as "the inflated,5
the bloated."
Having defined it in this way he should apprehend the sign in the following six
ways, that is to say, (1) by its colour, (2) by its mark, (3) by its shape, [184] (4) by its
direction, (5) bv its location, (6) by its delimitation. How?
36.	(1) The meditator should define it by its colour thus: "This is the body of one
who is black or white or yellow-skinned."
37.	(2) Instead of defining it by the female mark or the male mark, he should
define it by its mark thus: "This is the body of one who was in the first phase of
life, in the middle phase, in the last phase."
38.	(3) By its shape: he should define it onlv by the shape of the bloated thus:
"This is the shape of its head, this is the shape of its neck, this is the shape of its
hand, this is the shape of its chest, this is the shape of its belly, this is the shape
of its navel, this is the shape of its hips, this is the shape of its thigh, this is the
shape of its calf, this is the shape of its foot."
39.	(4) He should define it by its direction thus: "There are two directions in this
body, that is, down from the navel as the lower direction, and up from it as the
upper direction." Or alternatively he can define it thus: "I am standing in this
direction; the sign of foulness is in that direction."
40.	(5) He should define it by its location thus: "The hand is in this location, the
foot in this, the head in this, the middle of the body in this." Or alternatively, he
can define it thus: "I am in this location; the sijgn of foulness is in that."
41.	(6) He should define it by its delimitation thus: "This body is delimited
below by the soles of the feet, above bv the tips of the hair, all round by the skin;
the space so delimited is filled up with thirty two pieces of corpse." Or
alternatively he can define it thus: "This is the delimitation of its hand, this is the
delimitation of its foot, this is the delimitation of its head, this is the delimitation
of the middle part of its body." Or alternatively he can delimit as much of it as he
has apprehended thus: "Just this much of the bloated is like this."
42. However, a female body is not appropriate for a man or a male one for a
woman; for the object, [namely the repulsive aspect], does not make its
appearance in a body of the opposite sex, which merely becomes a condition
for the wrong kind of excitement.6 To quote the Majjhima Commentary: "Even
5.	Vci n ita—"inflated": glossed by Vism-mht with sfu in (swollen). Not in PED in this sense.
6.	Vipphandana—"wrong kind of excitement": Vism-mht says here "Kilesa-
paripphandanass' eva nimittam hotI ti attho (the meaning is, it becomes the sign for
interference by (activity of) defilement" (Vism-mht 170). Phandati and vipphandati are
both given only such meanings as "to throb, stir, twitch" and paripphandati is not in
PED For the sense of wrong (vi-) excitement (phandana) cf. IV89 and XIV132 and note.
There seems to be an association of meaning between vipphara, vyapara, vipphaudaiia,
ihaka, and paripphandana (perhaps also abhoga) in the general senses of interestedness,
activity concern, interference, intervention, etc.
`175
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
when decaying,7 a woman invades a man's mind and stays there." That is
why the sign should be apprehended in the six ways only in a body of the
same sex.
43.	But when a clansman has cultivated the meditation subject under former
Enlightened Ones, kept the ascetic practices, threshed out the great primary
elements, discerned formations, defined mentaljity-materialitv, eliminated the
perception of a being, done the ascetic's [185] duties, lived the moral life, and
developed the development, when he contains the seed [of turning away from
formations], and has mature knowledge and little defilement, then the
counterpart sign appears to him in the place while he keeps looking. If it does
not appear in that way, then it appears to him as he is apprehending the sign in
the six ways.
44.	But if it does not appear to him even then, he should apprehend the sign
again in five more wavs: (7) by its joints, (8) by its openings, (9) by its concavities,
(10) by its convexities, and (11) all round.
45.	Herein, (7) by its joints is [properly] by its hundred and eighty joints. But
how can he define the hundred and eighty joints in the bloated? Consequently
he can define it by its fourteen major joints thus: Three joints in the right arm,
three in the left arm, three in the right leg, three in the left leg, one neck joint, one
waist joint.
46.	(8) By its openings: an "opening" is the hollow between the arm [and the
side], the hollow between the legs, the hollow of the stomach, the hollow of the
ear. He should define it by its openings in this way Or alternatively the opened
or closed state of the eyes and the opened or closed sta|te of the mouth can be
defined.
47.	(9) By its concavities: he should define any concave place on the body such
as the eye sockets or the inside of the mouth or the base of the neck. Or he can
define it thus: "I am standing in a concave place, the body is in a convex place."
48.	(10) By its convexities: he should define any raised place on the body such
as the knee or the chest or the forehead. Or he can define it thus: "I am standing
in a convex place, the body is in a concave place."
49.	(11) All round: the whole body should be defined all round. After working
over the whole body with knowledge, he should establish his mind thus, "The
bloated, the bloated," upon any part that appears clearly to him. If it has not
appeared even yet, and if there is special intensity of the bloatedness in the belly8
he should establish his mind thus, "The bloated, the bloated," on that.
50.	Now, as to the words, he sees that the sign is properly apprehended, etc., the
explanation is this. The meditator should apprehend the sign thoroughly in
that body in the way of apprehending the sign already described. He should
7.	The Harvard text has ugghatita, but Vism-mht (p. 170) reads "ugghanita (not in
PED) pl-tl uddliuniatakabhavappatta pi sabbaso kuthita-sarlra-pl-ti attho."
8.	"Udara-pariyosanam uparisarlrarn" (Vism-mht 172). Pariyosana here means "intensity"
though normally it means "end"; but see PED pariyosita.
`176
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
advert to it with well-established mindfulness. He should see that it is properly
remembered, properly defined, by doing that again and again. Standing in a
place not too far from and not too near to the body he should open his eyes, look
and apprehend the sign. [186] He should open his eyes and look a hundred
times, a thousand times, [thinking], "Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness
of the bloated," and he should close his eyes and advert to it.
51.	As he does so again and again, the learning sign becomes properly
apprehended by him. When is it properly apprehended? When it comes into
focus alike whether he opens his eves and looks or closes his eyes and adverts,
then it is called properly apprehended.
52.	When he has thus properly apprehended the sign, properly remembered
it, and properly defined it, then if he is unable to conclude his development on
the spot, he can go to his own lodging, alone, in the same way as described of his
coming, with no companion, keeping that same meditation subject in mind,
with mindfulness well established, and with his mind not turned outwards
owing to his faculties being turned inwards.
53.	As he leaves the charnel ground he should define the path he comes back
by thus: "The path by which I have left goes in an easterly direction, westerly ...
northerly ... southerly direction," or "It goes in an intermediate direction"; or
"In this place it goes to the left, in this place to the right"; and "In this place
there is a stone, in this a termite-mound, in this a tree, in this a bush, in this a
creeper."
54.	When he has defined the path he has come back by and when, once back,
he is walking up and down, he should see that his walk is oriented towards it
too; the meaning is that he should walk up and down on a piece of ground that
faces in the direction of the sign of foulness. And when he sits, he should prepare
a seat oriented towards it too.
55.	But if there is a bog or a ravine or a tree or a fence or a swamp in that
direction, if he cannot walk up and down on a piece of ground facing in that
direction, if he cannot prepare his seat thus because there is no room for it, then
he can both walk up and down and sit in a place where there is room, even
though it does not face that way; but he should turn his mind in that direction.
56. Now, as to the questions beginning with what is the purpose ... characterizing
the surrounding signs? The intention of the answer that begins with the words, has
non-delusion for its purpose, is this: If someone goes at the wrong time to the place
where the sign of the bloated is, and opens his eyes for the purpose of
apprehending the sign by characterizing the surrounding signs, then as soon
as he looks the dead body appears [187] as if it were standing up and threatening9
and pursuing him, and when he sees the hideous and fearful object, his mind
reels, he is like one demented, gripped by panic, fear and terror, and his hair
stands on end. For among the thirty-eight meditation subjects expounded in the
texts no object is so frigh|tening as this one. There are some who lose jhana in
this meditation subject. Wliv? Because it is so frightening.
9. There is no sense of ajjliottharati given in PED that fits here. Cf. 1.56.
`177
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
57.	So the meditator must stand firm. Establishing his mindfulness well, he
should remove his fears in this way: "No dead body gets up and pursues one. If
that stone or that creeper close to it were to come, the body might come too; but
since that stone or that creeper does not come, the body will not come either. Its
appearance to you in this way is born: of your perception, created by your
perception. Today your meditation subject has appeared to you. Do not be afraid,
bhikkhu." He should laugh it off and direct his mind to the sign. In that wav he
will arrive at distinction. The words "Characterizing the surrounding signs
has non-delusion for its purpose" are said on this account.
58.	To succeed in apprehending the sign in the eleven wavs is to anchor the
meditation subject. For the opening of his eves and looking conditions the arising
of the learning sign; and as he exercises his mind on that the counterpart sign
arises; and as he exercises his mind on that he reaches absorption. When he is
sure of absorption, he works up insight and realizes Arahantship. Hence it was
said: apprehending the sign in the [other] eleven ways has anchoring [the mind] for its
purpose.
59.	The reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping [the mind] on the track
for its purpose: the meaning is that the reviewing of the path gone by and of the
path come back bv mentioned is for the purpose of keeping properly to the track
of the meditation subject.
60.	For if this bhikkhu is going along with his meditation subject and people
on the way ask him about the day "What is today, venerable sir?" or they ask him
some question [about Dhamma], or they welcome him, he ought not to go on in
silence, thinking "I have a meditation subject." The day must be told, the question
must be answered, even by saving "I do not know" if he does not know, a legitimate
welcome must be responded to. [188] As he does so, the newly acquired sign
vanishes. But even if it does vanish, he should still tell the day when asked; if he
does not know the answer to the question, he should still say "I do not know,"
and if he does know it, he should explain it surely;10 and he must respond to a
welcome. Also reception of visitors must be attended to on seeing a visiting
bhikkhu, and all the remaining duties in the Khandhakas must be carried out
too, that is, the duties of the shrine terrace, the duties of the Bodhi-tree terrace, the
duties of the Uposatlia house, the duties of the refectory and the bath house, and
those to the teacher, the preceptor, visitors, departing bhikkhus, and the rest.
61.	And the newly acquired sign vanishes while he is carrying out these too.
When he wants to go again, thinking "I shall go and take up the sign," he finds
he cannot go to the charnel ground because it has been invaded by non-human
beings or by wild beasts, or the sign has disappeared. For a bloated corpse only
lasts one or two days and then turns into a livid corpse. Of all the meditation
subjects there is none so hard to come by as this.
62.	So when the sign has vanished in this way, the bhikkhu should sit down in
his night quarters or in his day quarters and first of all review the path gone by
and come by up to the place where he is actually sitting cross-legged, doing it in
10. Reading ekamsena (surely) with Harvard text rather than ekadesena (partly).
`178
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
this way: "I went out of the monastery by this gate, I took a path leading in such
and such a direction, I turned left at such and such |a place, I turned right at such
and such a place, in one part of it there was a stone, in another a termite-mound
or a tree or a bush or a creeper; having gone by that path, I saw the foulness in
such and such a place, I stood there facing in such and such a direction and
observed such and such surrounding signs, I apprehended the sign of foulness
in this wav; I left the charnel ground in such and such a direction, I came back
by such and such a path doing this and this, and I am now sitting here."
63.	As he reviews it in this way, the sign becomes evident and appears as if
placed in front of him; the meditation subject rides in its track as it did before.
Hence it was said: the reviewing of the path gone by and come by has keeping [the
mind] on the track for its purpose.
64.	Now, as to the words, when he has established reverence for it by seeing its
advantages and by perceiving it as a treasure and so come to love it, he anchors
the mind on that object: here, having gained jhana by exercising his mind on the
repulsiveness in the bloated, he should increase insight with the jhana as its
proximate cause, and then he should see the advantages in this way: [189]
"Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing and death."
65. Just as a pauper who acquired a treasure of gems would guard and love it
with great affection, feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of
it, "I have got what is hard indeed to get!" so too [this bhikkhu] should guard
the sign, loving it and feeling reverence for it as one who appreciates the value of
it, "I have got this meditation subject, which is indeed as hard to get as a very
valuable treasure is for a pauper to get. For one whose meditation subject is the
four elements discerns the four primary elements in himself, one whose meditation
subject is breathing discerns the wind in his own nostrils, and one whose
meditation subject is a kasina makes a kasina and develops it at his ease, so these
other meditation subjects are easily got. But this one lasts onlv one, or two days,
after which it turns into a livid corpse. There is none harder to get than this
one." In his night quarters and in his day quarters he should keep his mind
anchored there thus, "Repulsiveness of the bloated, repulsiveness of the bloated."
And he should advert to the sign, bring it to mind and strike at it with thought
and applied thought over and over again.
66.	As he does so, the counterpart sign arises. Here is the difference between
the two signs. The learning sign appears as a hideous, dreadful and frightening
sight; but the counterpart sign appears like a man wi|tli big limbs lying down
after eating his fill.
67.	Simultaneously with his acquiring the counterpart sign, his lust is
abandoned by suppression owing to his giving no attention externally to sense
desires [as object]. And owing to his abandoning of approval, ill will is abandoned
too, as pus is with the abandoning of blood. Likewise stiffness and torpor are
abandoned through exertion of energy agitation and worry are abandoned
through devotion to peaceful things that cause no remorse; and uncertainty
about the Master who teaches the way about the way and about the fruit of the
way, is abandoned through the actual experience of the distinction attained. So
`179
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
the five hindrances are abandoned. And there are present applied thought with
the characteristic of directing the mind on to that same sign, and sustained
thought accomplishing the function of pressing on the sign, and happiness
due to the acquisition of distinction, and tranquillity due to the production of
tranquillity in one whose mind is happy and bliss with that tranquillity as its
sign, [190] and unification that has bliss as its sign due to the production of
concentration in one whose mind is blissful. So the jhana factors become manifest.
68.	Thus access, which is the obverse of the first jhana, is produced in| him too
at that same moment. All after that up to absorption in the first jhana and mastery
in it should be understood as described under the earth kasina.
69.	As regards the livid and the rest: the characterizing already described,
starting with the going in the wav beginning "One who is learning the bloated
sign of foulness goes alone with no companion, with unremitting mindfulness
established" (§19), should all be understood with its exposition and intention,
substituting for the word "bloated" the appropriate word in each case thus:
"One who is learning the livid sign of foulness , "One who is learning the
festering sign of foulness ..." But the differences are as follows.
[The Livid]
70.	The livid should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the livid,
repulsiveness of the livid." Here the learning sign appears blotchy-coloured;
but the counterpart sign's appearance has the colour which is most prevalent.
[The Festering]
71.	The festering should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the festering,
repulsiveness of the festering." Here the learning sign appears as though
trickling; but the counterpart sign appears motionless and quiet.
[The Cut Up]
72.	The cut up is found on a battlefield or in a robbers' forest or on a charnel
ground where kings have robbers cut up or in the jungle in a place where men
are torn up by lions and tigers. So, if when he goes there, it comes into focus at
one adverting although lying in different places, that is good. If not, then he
should not touch it with his own hand; for bv doing so he would become familiar
with it.11 He should get a monastery attendant or one studying to become an
ascetic or someone else to put it together in one place. If he cannot find anyone
to do it, he should put it together with a walking stick or a staff in such a way
that there is only a finger's breadth separating [the parts]. Having put it together
thus, he should bring it to mind as "Repulsiveness of the cut up, repulsiveness of
the cut up." Herein, the learning sign appears as though cut in the middle; but
the counterpart sign appears whole. [191]
11. "He would come to handle it without disgust as a corpse-burner would"
(Vism-mht 176.).
`180
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[The Gnawed]
73.	The gnawed should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the gnawed,
repulsiveness of the gnawed." Here the learning sign appears as though gnawed
here and there; but the counterpart sign appears whole.
[The Scattered]
74.	After getting the scattered put together or putting it together in the way
described under the cut up so that there is onlv a finger's breadth, separating
[the pieces], it should be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the scattered,
repulsiveness of the scattered." Here the learning sign appears with the gaps
evident; but the counterpart sign appears whole.
[The Hacked and Scattered]
75.	The hacked and scattered is found in the same places as those described
under the cut up. Therefore, after going there and getting it put together or
putting it together in the wav described under the cut up so that there is onlv a
finger's breadth separating [the pieces], it should be brought to mind as
"Repulsiveness of the hacked and scattered, repulsiveness of the hacked and
scattered." Here, when the learning sign becomes evident, it does so with the
fissures of the wounds; but the counterpart sign appears whole.
[The Bleeding]
76.	The bleeding is found at the time when [blood] is trickling from the openings
of wounds received on battlefields, etc., or from the openings of burst boils and
abscesses when the hands and feet have been cut off. So on seeing that, it should
be brought to mind as "Repulsiveness of the bleeding, repulsiveness of the
bleeding." Here the learning sign appears to have the aspect of moving like a
red banner struck by wind; but the counterpart sign appears quiet.
[The Worm-Infested]
77.	There is a worm-infested corpse when at the end of two or three days a mass
of maggots oozes out from the corpse's nine orifices, and the mass lies there like
a heap of paddy or boiled rice as big as the body whether the body is that of a
dog, a jackal, a human being,12 an ox, a buffalo, an elephant, a horse, a python,
or what you will. It can be brought to mind with respect to anyone of these as
"Repulsiveness of the worm-infested, repulsiveness of the worm-infested." For
the sign arose for the Elder Cula-Pindapatika-Tissa in the corpse of an elephant's
carcass in the Kaladlghavapi reservoir. Here the learning sign appears as though
moving; but the counterpart sign appears quiet, like a ball of boiled rice.
[A Skeleton]
78. A skeleton is described in various aspects in the way beginning "As though
he were looking at a corpse thrown onto a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh
12. Reading rnanussa with Sinhalese ed.
`181
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
and blood, held together by sinews" (D II 296). [192] So he should go in the wav
already described to where it has been put, and noticing any stones, etc., with
their surrounding signs and in relation, to the object, he should characterize it
by the fact of its having attained that particular individual essence thus, "This is a
skeleton," and he should apprehend the sign in the eleven ways by colour and
the rest. But if he looks at it, [apprehending it only] bv its colour as white, it does
not appear to him [with its individual essence as repulsive], but only as a variant
of the white kasina. Consequently he should only look at it as 'a skeleton' in the
repulsive aspect.
79. "Mark" is a term for the hand, etc., here, so he should define it by its mark
according to hand, foot, head, chest, arm, waist, thigh, and shin. He should
define it by its shape, however, according as it is long, short, square, round, small
or large. By its direction and by its location are as already described (§39-40).
Having defined it by its delimitation according to the periphery of each bone, he
should reach absorption by apprehending whichever appears most evident to
him. But it can also be defined by its concavities and by its convexities according to
the concave and convex places in each bone. And it can also be defined by
position thus: "I am standing in a concave place, the skeleton is in a convex
place; or I am standing in a convex place, the skeleton is in a concave place." It
should be defined by its joints according as anv two bones are joined together. It
should be defined by its openings according to the gaps separating the bones. It
should be defined all round bv directing knowledge to it comprehensively thus:
"In this place there is this skeleton." If the sign does not arise even in this way
then the mind should be established on the frontal bone. And in this case, just as
in the case of those that precede it beginning with the worm-infested, the
apprehending of the sign should be observed in this elevenfold manner as
appropriate.
80. This meditation subject is successful with a whole skeleton frame and even
with a single bone as well. So having learnt the sign in anvone of these in the
eleven ways, he should bring it to mind as "Repulsiveness of a skeleton,
repulsiveness of a skeleton." Here the learning sign and the counterpart sign
are alike, so it is said. That is correct for a single bone. But when the learning
sign becomes manifest in a skeleton frame, what is correct [to say] is that there
are gaps in the learning sign while the counterpart sign appears whole. [193]
And the learning sign even in a single bone should be dreadful and terrifying
but the counterpart sign produces happiness and joy because it brings access.
81. What is said in the Commentaries in this context allows that deduction.
For there, after saving this, "There is no counterpart sign in the four divine
abidings and in the ten kinds of foulness; for in the case of the divine abidings
the sign is the breaking down of boundaries itself, and in the case of the ten
kinds of foulness the sign comes into being as soon as the repulsiveness is seen,
without anv thinking about it," it is again said, immediately next: "Here the
sign is twofold: the learning sign and the counterpart sign. The learning sign
appears hideous, dreadful and terrifying," and so on. So what we said was well
considered. And it is onlv this that is correct h|ere. Besides, the appearance of a
`182
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
woman's whole body as a collection of bones to the Elder Malia-Tissa through
his merely looking at her teeth demonstrates th|is here (see 1.55).
[General]
82.	The Divine Ruler with ten hundred eyes
Did him with the Ten Powers eulogize,
Who, fair in fame, made known as cause of jhana
This foulness of ten species in such wise.
Now, knowing their description and the way
To tackle each and how they are developed,
There are some further points that will repay
Study each with its special part to play.
83.	One who has reached jhana in anyone of these goes free from cupidity; he
resembles [an Arahant] without greed because his greed has been well
suppressed. At the same time, however, this classification of foulness should be
understood as stated in accordance with the particular individual essences
successively reached bv the [dead] body and also in accordance with the
particular subdivisions of the greedy temperament.
84.	When a corpse has entered upon the repulsive state, it may have reached
the individual essence of the bloated or anyone of the individual essences
beginning with that of the livid. So the sign should be apprehended as
"Repulsiveness of the bloated," "Repulsiveness of the livid," according to
whichever he has been able to find. This, it should be understood, is how the
classification of foulness comes to be tenfold with] the body's arrival at each
particular individual essence.
85.	And individually the bloated suits one who is greedy about shape since it
makes evident the disfigurement of the body's shape. The livid suits one who is
greedy about the body's colour since it makes evident the disfigurement of the
skin's colour. The festering [194] suits one who is greedy about the smell of the
body aroused by scents, perfumes, etc., since it makes evident the evil smells
connected with this sore, the body. The cut up suits one who is greedy about
compactness in the body since it makes evident the hollowness inside it. The
gnawed suits one who is greedy about accumulation of flesh in such parts of the
body as the breasts since it makes it evident how a fine accumulation of flesh
comes to nothing. The scattered suits one who is greedy about the grace of the
limbs since it makes it evident how limbs can be scattered. The hacked and
scattered suits one who is greedy about a fine body as a whole since it makes
evident the disintegration and alteration of the body as a whole. The bleeding
suits one who is greedy about elegance produced by ornaments since it makes
evident its repulsiveness when smeared with blood. The worm-infested suits one
who is greedy about ownership of the body since it makes it evident how the
body is shared with many families of worms. A skeleton suits one who is greedy
about fine teeth since it makes evident the repulsiveness of the bones in the body
This, it should be understood, is how the classification of foulness comes to be
tenfold according to the subdivisions of the greedy temperament.

Foulness as a Meditation Subject
86.	But as regards the tenfold foulness, just as it is only by virtue of its rudder
that a boat keeps steady in a river with turbulent13 waters and a rapid current,
and it cannot be steadied without a rudder, so too [here], owing to the weak hold
on the object, consciousness when unified only keeps steady by virtue of applied
thought, and it cannot be steadied without applied thought, which is why there
is only the first jhana here, not the second and the rest.
87.	And repulsive as this object is, still it arouses joy and happiness in him by
his seeing its advantages thus, "Surely in this way I shall be liberated from ageing
and death/' and by his abandoning the hindrances' oppression; just as a garbage
heap does in a flower-scavenger bv his seeing the advantages thus, "Now I shall
get a high wage," and as the workings of purges and emetics do in a man
suffering the pains of sickness.
88.	This foulness, while of ten kinds, has only one characteristic. For though it
is of ten kinds, nevertheless its characteristic is onlv its impure, stinking,
disgusting and repulsive state (essence). And foulness appears with this
characteristic not only in a dead body but also in a living one, as it did to the
Elder Maha-Tissa who lived at Cetiyapabbata (1.55), and to the novice attendant
on the Elder Sangharakkhita while he was watching the king riding an elephant.
For a living body is just as foul as a dead one, [195] only the characteristic of
foulness is not evident in a living body, being hidden by adventitious
embellishments.
89. This is the body's nature: it is a collection of over three hundred bones,
jointed by one hundred and eighty joints, bound together by nine hundred
sinews, plastered over with nine hundred pieces of flesh, enveloped in the moist
inner skin, enclosed in the outer cuticle, with orifices here and there, constantly
dribbling and trickling like a grease pot, inhabited by a community of worms,
the home of disease, the basis of painful states, perpetually oozing from the nine
orifices like a chronic open carbuncle, from both of whose eyes eye-filth trickles,
from whose ears comes ear-filth, from whose nostrils snot, from whose mouth
food and bile and phlegm and blood, from whose lower outlets excrement and
urine, and from whose ninety-nine thousand pores the broth of stale sweat
seeps, with bluebottles and their like buzzing round it, which when untended
with tooth sticks and mouth-washing and head-anointing and bathing and
underclothing and dressing would, judged by the universal repulsiveness of
the body make even a king, if he wandered from village to village with his hair
in its natural wild disorder, no different from a flower-scavenger or an outcaste
or what you will. So there is no distinction between a king's body and an outcaste's
in so far as its impure stinking nauseating repulsiveness is concerned.
90. But by rubbing out the stains on its teeth with tooth sticks and mouth-
washing and all that, by concealing its private parts under several cloths, by
daubing it with various scents and salves, bv pranking it with nosegays and
such things, it is worked up into a state that permits of its being take|u as "I" and
13. Aparisanthita—"turbulent." Parisanthati (to quiet) is not in PED. Aparisanthita is
not in CPD.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
"mine." So men delight in women and women in men without perceiving the
true nature of its characteristic foulness, now masked by this adventitious
adornment. But in the ultimate sense there is no place here even the size of an
atom fit to lust after.
91. And then, when any such bits of it as head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth,
spittle, snot, excrement or urine have dropped off the body beings will not touch
them; they are ashamed, humiliated and disgusted. But as long as anvone of
these things remains in it, though it is just as repulsive, they take it as agreeable,
desirable, permanent, [196] pleasant, self, because thev are wrapped in the murk
of ignorance and dved with affection and greed for self. Taking it as thev do,
they resemble the old jackal who saw a flower not yet fallen from a kimsuka tree in
a forest and yearned after it, thinking, "This is a piece of meat, it is a piece of
meat."
92.	There was a jackal chanced to see
A flowering kimsuka in a wood;
In haste he went to where it stood:
"I have found a meat-bearing tree!"
He chewed the blooms that fell, but could,
Of course, find nothing fit to eat;
He took it thus: "Unlike the meat
There on the tree, this is no good."
A wise man will not think to treat
As foul only the part that fell,
But treats as foul the part as well
That in the body has its seat.
Fools cannot in their folly tell;
Thev take the body to be fair,
And soon get caught in Evil's snare
Nor can escape its painful spell.
But since the wise have thus laid bare
This filthy body's nature, so,
Be it alive or dead, they know
There is no beauty lurking there.
93. For this is said:
"This filthy body stinks outright
Like ordure, like a privy's site;
This body men that have insight
Condemn, as object of a fool's delight.
"A tumour where nine holes abide
Wrapped in a coat of clammy hide
And trickling filth on every side,
Polluting the air with stenches far and wide.
`185
Chapter VI
Foulness as a Meditation Subject
"If it perchance should come about
That what is inside it came out,
Surely a man would need a knout
With which to put the crows and dogs to rout."
94. So a capable bhikkhu should apprehend the sign wherever the aspect of
foulness is manifest, whether in a living body or in a dead one, and he should
make the meditation subject reach absorption.
The sixth chapter called "The Description of Foulness as
a Meditation Subject" in the Treatise on the Development
of Concentration in the Path of Purification composed for

Chapter VII
Six Recollections
(Cha-anussati-niddesa)
1. [197] Now, ten recollections were listed next after the ten kinds of foulness
(III. 105). As to these:
Mindfulness (sati) itself is recollection (anussati) because it arises again and
again; or alternatively, the mindfulness (sati) that is proper (anurupa) for a
clansman gone forth out of faith, since it occurs only in those instances where it
should occur, is "recollection" (anussati).
The recollection arisen inspired by the Enlightened One is the recollection of
the Buddha. This is a term for mindfulness with the Enlightened One's special
qualities as its object.
The recollection arisen inspired by the Law is the recollection of the Dhamma.1
This is a term for mindfulness with the special qualities of the Law's being well
proclaimed, etc., as its object.
--
1. The word dhamma—perhaps the most important and frequently used of Pali
words—has no single equivalent in English because no English word has both a
generalization so wide and loose as the word dhamma in its widest sense (which
includes "everything" that can be known or thought of in any wav) and at the same
time an ability to be, as it were, focused in a set of well-defined specific uses. Roughly
7	'-1	O 7
dhamma = what-can-be-remembered or what-can-be-bome-in-mind (dharetabba) as
kamma = what-can-be-done (katabba). The following two principal (and overlapping)
senses are involved here: (i) the Law as taught, and (ii) objects of consciousness, (i) In
the first case the word has either been left untranslated as "Dhamma" or "dhamma"
or it has been tendered as "Law" or "law" This ranges from the loose sense of the
"Good Law," "cosmic law," and "teaching" to such specific technical senses as the
"discrimination of law," "causality," "being subject to or having the nature of." (ii) In
the second case the word in its looser sense of "something known or thought of" has
either been left untranslated as "dhamma" or rendered by "state" (more rarely by
"thing" or "phenomenon"), while in its technical sense as one of the twelve bases or
eighteen elements "mental object" and "mental datum" have been used. The sometimes
indiscriminate use of "dhamma," "state" and "law" in both the looser senses is
deliberate. The English words have been reserved as far as possible for rendering
dhamma (except that "state" has sometimes been used to render bhava, etc., in the
sense of "-ness"). Other subsidiary meanings of a non-technical nature have
occasionally been otherwise rendered according to context.
`187
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
The recollection arisen inspired by the Community is the recollection of the
Sangha. This is a term for mindfulness with the Community's special qualities of
being entered on the good way etc., as its object.
The recollection arisen inspired by virtue is the recollection of virtue. This is a term
for mindfulness with the special qualities of virtue's untomness, etc., as its object.
The recollection arisen inspired by generosity is the recollection of generosity.
This is a term for mindfulness with generosity's special qualities of free
generosity etc., as its object.
The recollection arisen inspired bv deities is the recollection of deities. This is a
term for mindfulness with the special qualities of one's own faith, etc., as its
object with deities standing as witnesses.
The recollection arisen inspired bv death is the recollection of death. This is a
term for mindfulness with the termination of the life faculty as its object.
[Mindfulness occupied with the body (kaya-gata sati—lit. "body-gone
mindfulness"):] it is gone (gata) to the material body (kaya) that is analyzed into
head hairs, etc., or it is gone into the body thus it is "body-gone" (kaya-gata). It is
body-gone (kaya-gata) and it is mindfulness (sati), thus it is "bodv-gone-
mindfulness" (kayagatasati—single compound); but instead of shortening [the
vowel] thus in the usual way "body-gone mindfulness" (kayagata sati—
compound adj. + noun) is said. This is a term for mindfulness that has as its
object the sign of the bodily parts consisting of head hairs and the rest.
The mindfulness arisen inspired by breathing (anapana) is mindfulness of
breathing. This is a term for mindfulness that has as its object the sign of in-
breaths and out-breaths.
In order to avoid muddle it is necessary to distinguish renderings of the word
dhamma and renderings of the words used to define it. The word itself is a gerundive
of the verb dharati (caus. dhareti—"to bear") and so is the literal equivalent of "[quality]
that is to be borne." But since the grammatical meanings of the two words dharati ("to
—--------- --------o -----~----------------D---* ...................... v —
bear") and daliati ("to put or sort out," whence dhatn—"element") sometimes coalesce,
it often comes very close to dhatu (but see VIII n. 68 and XI.104). If it is asked, what
bears the qualities to be borne? A correct answer here would probably be that it is the
event (samaya), as stated in the Dhammasarigani (§1, etc.), in which the various
dhammas listed there arise and are present, variously related to each other. The word
dhammin (thing qualified or "bearer of what is to be borne") is a late introduction as a
logical term (perhaps first used in Pali by Vism-mht, see p. 534).
As to the definitions of the word, there are several. At D-a I 99 four meanings are
given: moral (meritorious) special quality (guna), preaching of the Law (desana), scripture
(pariyatti), and "no-living-being-ness" (nissattata). Four meanings are also given at
Dhs-a 38: scripture (pariyatti), cause (of effect) as law (hetu), moral (meritorious)
special quality (guna), and "no-living-being-ness and soullessness" (nissatta-nijjwata).
A wider definition is given at M-a 117, where the following meanings are distinguished:
scriptural mastery (pariyatti—A III 86) truth, (sacca—Vin 112) concentration, (samadhi—
DII54) understanding, (panita—J-a 1280) nature, (pakati—M1162) individual essence,
(sabhava—Dhs 1) voidness, (sunnata—Dhs 25) merit, (punna—S I 82) offence, (apatti—
Vin III 187) what is knowable, (neyya—Patis II194) "and so on" (see also VIII n. 68).

Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
The recollection arisen inspired by peace is the recollection of peace. This is a
term that has as its object the stilling of all suffering.
[(1) Recollection of the Enlightened One]
2.	[198] Now, a meditator with absolute confidence2 who wants to develop firstly
the recollection of the Enlightened One among these ten should go into solitary
retreat in a favourable abode and recollect the special qualities of the Enlightened
One, the Blessed One, as follows:
That Blessed One is such since he is accomplished, fully enlightened, endowed
with [clear] vision and [virtuous] conduct, sublime, the knower of worlds, the
incomparable leader of men to be tamed, the teacher of gods and men,
enlightened and blessed (M I 37; A III 285).
3.	Here is the wav he recollects: "That Blessed One is such since he is
accomplished, he is such since he is fully enlightened, ... he is such since he is
blessed"—he is so for these several reasons, is what is meant.
[Accomplished]
4.	Herein, what he recollects firstly is that the Blessed One is accomplished (arahanta)
for the following reasons: (i) because of remoteness (araka), and (ii) because of
his enemies (ari) and (iii) the spokes (ara) having been destroyed (hata), and (iv)
because of his worthiness (araha) of requisites, etc., and (v) because of absence of
secret (rahabhava) evil-doing.3
5.	(i) He stands utterly remote and far away from all defilements because he has
expunged all trace of defilement by means of the path—because of such
remoteness (araka) he is accomplished (arahanta).
A man remote (araka) indeed we call
From something he has not at all;
The Saviour too that has no stain
May well the name "accomplished" (arahanta) gain.
6.	(ii) And these enemies (ari), these defilements, are destroyed (hata) by the
path—because the enemies are thus destroyed he is accomplished (arahanta)
also.
The enemies (ari) that were deployed,
Greed and the rest, have been destroyed (hata)
By his, the Helper's, wisdom's sword,
So he is "accomplished" (arahanta), all accord.
7. (iii) Now, this wheel of the round of rebirths with its hub made of ignorance
and of craving for becoming, with its spokes consisting of formations of merit
and the rest, with its rim of ageing and death, which is joined to the chariot of
--
2.	"'Absolute confidence' is the confidence afforded by the noble path. Development
of the recollection comes to success in him who has that, not in any other" (Vism-mht
181). "Absolute confidence" is a constituent of the first three "factors of strearn-
entry" (see S V 196).
3.	Cf. derivation of the word ariya ("noble") at M-a I 21.

Chapter VII
Six Recollections
the triple becoming by piercing it with the axle made of the origins of cankers
(see M I 55), has been revolving throughout time that has no beginning. All of
this wheel's spokes (ara) were destroyed (hata) by him at the Place of
Enlightenment, as he stood firm with the feet of energy on the ground of virtue,
wielding with the hand of faith the axe of knowledge that destroys kamma—
because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished (arahanta) also.
8.	Or alternatively it is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the
"wheel of the round of rebirths." Ignorance is its hub because it is its root.
Ageing-and-death is its rim because it terminates it. The remaining ten states [of
the dependent origination] are its spokes because ignorance is their root and
ageing-and-death their termination.
9.	Herein, ignorance is unknowing about suffering and the rest. And ignorance
in sensual becoming [199] is a condition for formations in sensual becoming.
Ignorance in fine-material becoming is a condition for formations in fine-material
becoming. Ignorance in immaterial becoming is a condition for formations in
immaterial becoming.
10.	Formations in sensual becoming are a condition for rebirth-linking
consciousness in sensual becoming. And similarly with the rest.
11.	Rebirth-linking consciousness in sensual becoming is a condition for
mentality-materiality in sensual becoming. Similarly in fine-material becoming.
In immaterial becoming it is a condition for mentality only.
12.	Mentality-materiality in sensual becoming is a condition for the sixfold
base in sensual becoming. Mentality-materiality in fine-material becoming is a
condition for three bases in fine-material becoming. Mentality in immaterial
becoming is a condition for one base in immaterial becoming.
13.	The sixfold base in sensual becoming is a condition for six kinds of contact
in sensual becoming. Three bases in fine-material becoming are conditions for
three kinds of contact in fine-material becoming. The mind base alone in
immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of contact in immaterial
becoming.
------—0-
14.	The six kinds of contact in sensual becoming are conditions for six kinds
of feeling in sensual becoming. Three kinds of contact in fine-material becoming
are conditions for three kinds of feeling there too. One kind of contact in
immaterial becoming is a condition for one kind of feeling there too.
15.	The six kinds of feeling in sensual becoming are conditions for the six
groups of craving in sensual becoming. Three in the fine-material becoming are
for three there too. One kind of feeling in the immaterial becoming is a condition
for one group of craving in the immaterial becoming. The craving in the several
kinds of becoming is a condition for the clinging there.
16.	Clinging, etc., are the respective conditions for becoming and the rest. In
what way? Here someone thinks, "I shall enjoy sense desires," and with sense-
desire clinging as condition he misconducts himself in body speech, and mind.
Owing to the fulfilment of his misconduct he reappears in a state of loss
(deprivation). The kamma that is the cause of his reappearance there is kamma-
`190
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
process becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-process
becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth, their maturing is ageing,
their dissolution is death.
17.	Another thinks, T sh|all enjoy the delights of heaven," and in the parallel
manner he conducts himself well. Owing to the fulfilment of his good conduct
he reappears in a [sensual-sphere] heaven. The kamma that is the cause of his
reappearance there is kamma-process becoming, and the rest as before.
18.	Another thinks, "I shall enjoy the delights of the Brahma-world," and with
sense-desire clinging as condition he develops loving-kindness, compassion,
gladness, and equanimity.4 [200] Owing to the fulfilment of the meditative
development he is reborn in the Brahma-world. The kamma that is the cause of
his rebirth there is kamma-process becoming, and the rest is as before.
19.	Yet another thinks, "I shall enjoy the delights of immaterial becoming,"
and with the same condition he develops the attainments beginning with the
base consisting of boundless space. Owing to the fulfilment of the development
he is reborn in one of these states. The kamma that is the cause of his rebirth there
is kamma-process becoming, the aggregates generated by the kamma are rebirth-
process becoming, the generating of the aggregates is birth, their maturing is
ag|eing, their dissolution is death (see M II 263). The remaining kinds of clinging
are construable in the same way.
20.	So, "Understanding of discernment of conditions thus, 'Ignorance is a
cause, formations are causally arisen, and both these states are causally arisen/
is knowledge of the causal relationship of states. Understanding of discernment
of conditions thus, Tn the past and in the future ignorance is a cause, formations
are causally arisen, and both these states are causally arisen/ is knowledge of
the causal relationship of states" (Patis I 50), and all the clauses should be given
in detail in this way
21.	Herein, ignorance and formations are one summarization; consciousness,
mentality-materiality the sixfold base, contact, and feeling are another; craving,
clinging, and becoming are another; and birth and ageing-and-death are
another. Here the first summarization is past, the two middle ones are present,
and birth and ageing-and-death are future. When ignorance and formations
are mentioned, thentates, became dispassionate towards them, when his greed
faded away, when he was liberated, then he destroyed, quite destroyed, abolished,
the spokes of this wheel of the round of rebirths of the kind just described.
22. Now, the Blessed One knew, saw, understood, and penetrated in all aspects
this dependent origination with its four summarizations, its three times, its
twenty aspects, and its three links. "Knowledge is in the sense of that being
known,5 and understanding is in the sense of the act of understanding that.
4. "Because of the words, 'Also all dhammas of the three planes are sense desires
(karna) in the sense of being desirable (kamanlya) (Cf. Nidd I 1: sabbepi kamavacara
dhamma, sabbepi rupavacara dhamma, sabbepi arupavacara dhamma ... kanianlyatthena ...
kania), greed for becoming is sense-desire clinging' (Vism-mht 184). See XII.72. For
the "way to the Brahma-world" see M II 194-96; 207f.
`191
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
Hence it was said: 'Understanding of discernment of conditions is knowledge
of the causal relationship of states'" (Patis I 52). Thus when the Blessed One, by
correctly knowing these states with knowledge of relations of states, became
dispassionate towards them, when his greed faded away when he was liberated,
then he destroyed, quite destroyed, abolished, the spokes of this wheel of the
round of rebirths of the kind just described.
Because the spokes are thus destroyed he is accomplished (arahanta) also.
[201]
The spokes (ara) of rebirth's wheel have been
Destroyed (hata) with wisdom's weapon keen
Bv him, the Helper of the World,
And so "accomplished" (arahanta) he is called.
23. (iv) And he is worthy (arahati) of the requisites of robes, etc., and of the
distinction of being accorded homage because it is he who is most worthy of
offerings. For when a Perfect One has arisen, important deities and human
beings pay homage to none else; for Brahma Sahampati paid homage to the
Perfect One with a jewelled garland as big as Sineru, and other deities did so
according to their means, as well as human beings as King Bimbisara [of
Magadha] and the king of Kosala. And after the Blessed One had finally attained
Nibbana, King Asoka renounced wealth to the amount of ninety-six million for
his sake and founded eight-four thousand monasteries throughout all
Jambudlpa (India). And so, with all these, what need to speak of others? Because
of worthiness of requisites he is accomplished (arahanta) also.
So he is worthy the Helper of the World,
Of homage paid with requisites; the word
"Accomplished" (arahanta) has this meaning in the world:
Hence the Victor is worthy of that word.
24. (v) And he does not act like those fools in the world who vaunt their
cleverness and vet do evil, but in secret for fear of getting a bad name. Because of
absence of secret (rahabhava) evil-doing he is accomplished (arahanta) also.
No secret evil deed may claim
An author so august; the name
"Accomplished" (arahanta) is his deservedly
Bv absence of such secrecy (rahabhava).
25. So in all ways:
The Sage of remoteness unalloyed,
Vanquished defiling foes deployed,
The spokes of rebirth's wheel destroyed,
Worthy of requisites employed,
Secret evil he does avoid:
For these five reasons he may claim
This word "accomplished" for his name.|

Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[Fully Enlightened]
26. He is fully enlightened (sammasambuddha) because he has discovered
(buddha) all things rightly (samma) and by himself (samam).
In fact, all things were discovered by him rightly by himself in that he
discovered, of the things to be directly known, that they must be directly known
(that is, learning about the four truths), of the things to be fully understood that
thev must be fully understood (that is, penetration of suffering), of the things to
be abandoned that they must be abandoned (that is, penetration of the origin of
suffering), of the things to be realized that they must be realized (that is,
penetration of the cessation of suffering), and of the things to be developed that
they must be developed (that is, penetration of the path). Hence it is said:
What must be directly known is directly known,
What has to be developed has been developed,
What has to be abandoned has been abandoned;
And that, brahman, is why I am enlightened (Sn 558).
27.	[202] Besides, he has discovered all things rightly by himself step by step
thus: The eye is the truth of suffering; the prior craving that originates it by being
its root-cause is the truth of origin; the non-occurrence of both is the truth of cessation;
the way that is the act of understanding cessation is the truth of the path. And so too
in the case of the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body and the mind.
28.	And the following things should be construed in the same way:
the six bases beginning with visible objects;
the six groups of consciousness beginning with eye-consciousness;
the six kinds of contact beginning with eye-contact;
the six kinds of feeling beginning with the eye-contact-born;
the six kinds of perception beginning with perception of visible objects;
the six kinds of volition beginning with volition about visible objects;
the six groups of craving beginning with craving for visible objects;
the six kinds of applied thought beginning with applied thought about visible
objects;
the six kinds of sustained thought beginning with sustained thought about
visible objects;
the five aggregates beginning with the aggregate of matter;
the ten kasinas;
the ten recollections;
the ten perceptions beginning with perception of the bloated;
the thirty-two aspects [of the body] beginning with head hairs;
the twelve bases;
the eighteen elements;
the nine kinds of becoming beginning with sensual becoming;6
`193
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
the four jhanas beginning with the first;
the four measureless states beginning with the development of loving-
kindness;
the four immaterial attainments;
the factors of the dependent origination in reverse order beginning with
ageing-and-death and in forward order beginning with ignorance (cf. XX.9).
29. Herein, this is the construction of a single clause [of the dependent
origination]: Ageing-and-death is the truth of suffering, birth is the truth of
origin, the escape from both is the truth of cessation, the way that is the act of
understanding cessation is the truth of the path.
In this way he has discovered, progressively discovered, completely discovered,
all states rightly and by himself step by step. Hence it was said above: "He is fully
enlightened because he has discovered all tilings rightly and by himself" (§26)7
[Endowed With Clear Vision and Virtuous Conduct]
30. He is endowed with [clear] vision and [virtuous] conduct: vijjacaranasampanno
= vijjahi caranena ca sampanno (resolution of compound).
6.	See XVII.253f. The word blrava is rendered here both by "existence" and by
"becoming." The former, while less awkward to the ear, is inaccurate if it is allowed a
flavour of staticness. "Becoming" will be more frequently used as this work proceeds.
Loosely the two senses tend to merge. But technically "existence" should perhaps be
used only for atthita, which signifies the momentary existence of a dhamma "possessed
of the three instants of arising, presence, and dissolution." ("Becoming" then signifies
the continuous flow or flux of such triple-instant moments; and it occurs in three main
modes: sensual, fine-material, and immaterial. For remarks on the words "being" and
"essence" see VIII n. 68.
7.	"Is not unobstructed knowledge (anavarana-nana) different from omniscient
knowledge (sabbannuta-nana)? Otherwise the words "Six kinds of knowledge unshared
[by disciples]" (Patis I 3) would be contradicted? [Note: The six kinds are: knowledge
of what faculties prevail in beings, knowledge of the inclinations and tendencies of
beings, knowledge of the Twin Marvel, knowledge of the attainment of the great
compassion, omniscient knowledge, and unobstructed knowledge (see Patis 1133)].—
There is no contradiction, because two ways in which a single kind of knowledge's
objective field occurs are described for the purpose of showing by means of this
difference how it is not shared by others.
It is onlv one kind of knowledge; but it is called omniscient knowledge because its
objective field consists of formed, unformed, and conventional (sammuti) [i.e.
conceptual] dhammas without remainder, and it is called unobstructed knowledge
because of its unrestricted access to the objective field, because of absence of
obstruction. And it is said accordingly in the Patisambhida: "It knows all the formed
and the unformed without remainder, thus it is omniscient knowledge. It has no
obstruction therein, thus it is unobstructed knowledge" (Patis I 131)|, and so on. So
they are not different kinds of knowledge. And there must be no reservation, otherwise
it would follow that omniscient and unobstructed knowledge had obstructions and
did not make all dhammas its object. There is not in fact a minimal obstruction to the

Herein, as to [clear] vision: there are three kinds of clear vision and eight kinds
of clear vision. The three kinds should be understood as stated in the
Bhayabherava Sutta (M I 22f.), and the eight kinds as stated in the Ambattha
Sutta (D 1100). For there eight kinds of clear vision are stated, made up of the six
kinds of direct-knowledge together with insight and the supernormal power of
the mind-made [body].
--
Blessed One's knowledge: and if his unobstructed knowledge did not have all dhammas
as its object, there would be presence of obstruction where it did not occur, and so it
would not be unobstructed.
"Or alternatively even if we suppose that they are different, still it is omniscient
knowledge itself that is intended as 'unhindered' since it is that which occurs
unhindered universally And it is by his attainment of that that the Blessed One is
known as Omniscient, All-seer, Fully Enlightened, not because of awareness (avabodha)
of every dhamma at once, simultaneously (see M II127). And it is said accordingly in
the Patisambhida: 'This is a name derived from the final liberation of the Enlightened
Ones, the Blessed Ones, together with the acquisition of omniscient knowledge at the
root of the Enlightenment Tree; this name "Buddha" is a designation based on
realization' (Patis 1174). For the ability in the Blessed One's continuity to penetrate all
dhammas without exception was due to his having completely attained to knowledge
capable of becoming aware of all dhammas.
"Here it may be asked: But how then? When this knowledge occurs, does it do so
with respect to every field simultaneously or successively? For firstly, if it occurs
simultaneously with respect to every objective field, then with the simultaneous
appearance of formed dhammas classed as past, future and present, internal and
external, etc., and of unformed and conventional (conceptual) dhammas, there would
be no awareness of contrast (patibhaga), as happens in one who looks at a painted
canvas from a distance. That being so, it follows that all dhammas become the objective
field of the Blessed One's knowledge in an undifferentiated form (anirupita-riipana),
as they do through the aspect of not-self to those who are exercising insight thus 'All
dhammas are not-self' (Dhp 279; Th 678; M1230; II64; S III 132; A1286; IV 14; Patis II
48, 62; Vin I 86. Cf. also A III 444; IV 88, 338; Sn 1076). And those do not escape this
difficulty who say that the Enlightened One's knowledge occurs with the characteristic
of presence of all knowable dhammas as its objective field, devoid of discriminative
thinking (vikappa-rahita), and universal in time (sabba-kala) and that is why they are
called 'All-seeing' and why it is said, 'The Naga is concentrated walking and he is
concentrated standing' (?).
Thev do not escape the difficulty since the Blessed One's knowledge would then
have only a partial objective field, because, by having the characteristic of presence as
its object, past, future and conventional dhammas, which lack that characteristic, would
be absent. So it is wrong to say that it occurs simultaneously with respect to every
objective field. Then secondly, if we say that it occurs successively with respect to
every objective field, that is wrong too. For when the knowable, classed in the many
different ways according to birth, place, individual essence, etc., and direction, place,
time, etc., is apprehended successively then penetration without remainder is not
effected since the knowable is infinite. And those are wrong too who say that the
Blessed One is All-seeing owing to his doing his defining by taking one part of the
knowable as that actually experienced (paccakklia) and deciding that the rest is the
same because of the unequivocalness of its meaning, and that such knowledge is not

31. [Virtuous] conduct should be understood as fifteen things, that is to say:
restraint by virtue, guarding of the sense faculties, knowledge of the right amount
in eating, devotion to wakefulness, the seven good states,8 and the four jhanas of
the fine-material sphere. For it is precisely by means of these fifteen things that a
noble disciple conducts himself, that he goes towards the deathless. That is why
it is called "[virtuous] conduct/' according as it is said, "Here, Mahanama, a
noble disciple has virtue" (M1355), etc, the whole of which should be unjderstood
as given in the Middle Fifty [of the Majjhima Nikaya].
--
inferential (anuntanika) since it is free from doubt, because it is what is doubtfully
discovered that is meant by inferential knowledge in the world. And they are wrong
because there is no such defining bv taking one part of the knowable as that actually
experienced and deciding that the rest is the same because of the unequivocalness of its
meaning, without making all of it actually experienced. For then that 'rest' is not actually
experienced; and if it were actually experienced, it would no longer be 'the rest.'
"All that is no argument.—Why not?—Because this is not a field for ratiocination;
for the Blessed One has said this: 'The objective field of Enlightened Ones is
unthinkable, it cannot be thought out; anyone who tried to think it out would reap
madness and frustration' (A II 80). The agreed explanation here is this: Whatever the
Blessed One wants to know—either entirely or partially—there his knowledge occurs
as actual experience because it does so without hindrance. And it has constant
concentration because of the absence of distraction. And it cannot occur in association
with wishing of a kind that is due to absence from the objective field of something that
he wants to know. There can be no exception to this because of the words, 'All dhammas
are available to the adverting of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, are available at
his wish, are available to his attention, are available to his thought' (Patis II195). And
the Blessed One's knowledge that has the past and future as its objective field is
entirely actual experience since it is devoid of assumption based on inference, tradition
or conjecture.
"And yet, even in that case, suppose he wanted to know the whole in its entirety
then would his knowledge not occur without differentiation in the whole objective
field simultaneously? And so there would still be no getting out of that difficulty?
"That is not so, because of its purifiedness. Because the Enlightened One's objective
field is purified and it is unthinkable. Otherwise there would be no unthinkableness in
the knowledge of the Enlightened One, the Blessed One, if it occurred in the same way
as that of ordinary people. So, although it occurs with all dhammas as its object, it
nevertheless does so making those dhammas quite clearly defined, as though it had
a single dhamma as its object. This is what is unthinkable here. '
There is as much knowledge as there is knowable, there is as much knowable as
there is knowledge; the knowledge is limited bv the knowable, the knowable is limited
bv the knowledge' (Patis II195). So he is Fullv Enlightened because he has rightly and
by himself discovered all dhammas together and separately, simultaneously and
successively according to his wish' (Vism-mht 190-91).
8. A possessor of "the seven" has faith, conscience, shame, learning, energy,
mindfulness, and understanding (see D III 252). PED traces saddhammci (as "the true
dhamma," etc.) to sant + dhamma; but it is as likely traceable to srad + dhamma = (good
ground) for the placing of faith (saddha).

[203] Now, the Blessed One is endowed with these kinds of clear vision and
with this conduct as well; hence he is called "endowed with [clear] vision and
[virtuous] conduct."
32. Herein, the Blessed One's possession of clear vision consists in the
fulfilment of omniscience (Patis I 131), while his possession of conduct consists
in the fulfilment of the great compassion (Patis I 126). He knows through
omniscience what is good and harmful for all beings, and through compassion
he warns them of harm and exhorts them to do good. That is how he is possessed
of clear vision and conduct, which is why his disciples have entered upon the
good wav instead of entering upon the bad way as the self-mortifying disciples
of those who are not possessed of clear vision and conduct have done.9

33. He is called sublime (sugata)10 (i) because of a manner of going that is good
(sobhana-gamana), (ii) because of being gone to an excellent place (sundaram
9. "Here the Master's possession of vision shows the greatness of understanding,
and his possession of conduct the greatness of his compassion. It was through
understanding that the Blessed One reached the kingdom of the Dhamma, and through
compassion that he became the bestower of the Dhamma. It was through
understanding that he felt revulsion for the round of rebirths, and through compassion
that he bore it. It was through understanding that he fully understood others' suffering,
and through compassion that he undertook to counteract it. It was through
understanding that he was brought face to face with Nibbana, and through compassion
that he attained it. It was through understanding that he himself crossed over, and
through compassion that he brought others across. It was through understanding
that he perfected the Enlightened One's state, and through compassion that he perfected
the Enlightened One's task.
"Or it was through compassion that he faced the round of rebirths as a Bodhisatta,
and through understanding that he took no delight in it. Likewise it was through
compassion that he practiced non-cruelty to others, and through understanding that
he was himself fearless of others. It was through compassion that he protected others
to protect himself, and through understanding that he protected himself to protect
others. Likewise it was through compassion that he did not torment others, and
through understanding that he did not torment himself; so of the four types of persons
beginning with the one who practices for his own welfare (A II 96) he perfected the
fourth and best type. Likewise it was through compassion that he became the world's
helper, and through understanding that he became his own helper. It was through
compassion that he had humility [as a Bodhisatta], and through understanding that
he had dignity [as a Buddha]. Likewise it was through compassion that he helped all
beings as a father while owing to the understanding associated with it his mind
remained detached from them all, and it was through understanding that his mind
remained detached from all dhammas while owing to the compassion associated with
it that he was helpful to all beings. For just as the Blessed One's compassion was
devoid of sentimental affection or sorrow, so his understanding was free from the
thoughts of T and 'mine'" (Vism-mht 192-93).

thanam gatatta), (iii) because of having gone rightly (sammagatatta), and (iv)
because of enunciating rightly (sammagadatta).
(i)	A manner of going (gamana) is called "gone" (gata), and that in the Blessed
One is good (sobhana), purified, blameless. But what is that? It is the noble path;
for by means of that manner of going he has "gone" without attachment in the
direction of safety—thus he is sublime (sugata) because of a manner of going that
is good.
(ii)	And it is to the excellent (sundara) place that he has gone (gata), to the
deathless Nibbana—thus he is sublime (sugata) also because of having gone to
an excellent place.
34. (iii) And he has rightly (samma) gone (gata), without going back again to
the defilements abandoned by each path. For this is said: "He does not again
turn, return, go back, to the defilements abandoned by the stream entry path,
thus he is sublime ... he does not again turn, return, go back, to the defilements
abandoned by the Arahant path, thus he is sublime" (old commentary?). Or
alternatively, he has rightly gone from the time of [making his resolution] at the
feet of Dlpahkara up till the Enlightenment Session, by working for the welfare
and happiness of the whole world through the fulfilment of the thirty perfections
and through following the right way without deviating towards either of the
two extremes, that is to say, towards eternalism or annihilationism, towards
indulgence in sense pleasures or self-mortification—thus he is sublime also
because of having gone| rightly.
35. (iv) And he enunciates11 (gadati) rightly (samma); he speaks only fitting
speech in the fitting place—thus he is sublime also because of enunciating
rightly.
Here is a sutta that confirms this: "Such speech as the Perfect One knows to be
untrue and incorrect, conducive to harm, and displeasing and unwelcome to
others, that he does not speak. And such speech as the Perfect One knows to be
true and correct, but conducive to harm, and displeasing and unwelcome to
others, that he does not speak. [204] And such speech as the Perfect One knows
to be true and correct, conducive to good, but displeasing and unwelcome to
others, that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound. Such speech as
the Perfect One knows to be untrue and incorrect, and conducive to harm, but
pleasing and welcome to others, that he does not speak. And such speech as the
Perfect One knows to be true and correct, but conducive to harm, though pleasing
and welcome to others, that he does not speak. And such speech as the Perfect
One knows to be true and correct, conducive to good, and pleasing and welcome
to others, that speech the Perfect One knows the time to expound" (M I 395)—
thus he is sublime also because of enunciating rightly.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[Knower of Worlds]
36. He is the knower of worlds because he has known the world in all ways. For
the Blessed One has experienced, known and penetrated the world in all ways to
its individual essence, its arising, its cessation, and the means to its cessation,
according as it is said: "Friend, that there is a world's end where one neither is
born nor ages nor dies nor passes away nor reappears, which is to be known or
seen or reached by travel—that I do not say. Yet I do not say that there is ending
of suffering without reaching the world's end. Rather, it is in this fathom-long
carcass with its perceptions and its consciousness that I make known the world,
the arising of the world, the cessation of the world, and the way leading to the
cessation of the world.
"Tis utterly impossible
To reach by travel the world's end;
But there is no escape from pain
Until the world's end has been reached.
It is a sage, a knower of the worlds,
Who gets to the world's end, and it is he
Whose life divine is lived out to its term;
He is at peace who the world's end has known
And hopes for neither this world nor the next" (S I 62).
37. Moreover, there are three worlds: the world of formations, the world of
beings, and the world of location. Herein, in the passage, "One world: all beings
subsist by nutriment" (Patis I 122), [205] the world of formations is to be
understood. In the passage, "'The world is eternal' or 'The world is not eternal'"
(M I 426) it is the world of beings. In the passage:
"As far as moon and sun do circulate
Shining12 and lighting up the [four] directions,
Over a thousand times as great a world
Your power holds unquestionable sway" (M I 328)—
it is the world of location. The Blessed One has known that in all ways too.
38.	Likewise, because of the words: "One world: all beings subsist by nutriment.
Two worlds: mentality and materiality. Three worlds: three kinds of feeling. Four
worlds: four kinds of nutriment. Five worlds: five aggregates as objects of clinging.
Six worlds: six internal bases. Seven worlds: seven stations of consciousness.
Eight worlds: eight worldly states. Nine worlds: nine abodes of beings. Ten worlds:
ten bases. Twelve worlds: twelve bases. Eighteen worlds: eighteen elements" (Patis I
122),13 this world of formations was known to him in all ways.
39.	But he knows all beings' habits, knows their inherent tendencies, knows
their temperaments, knows their bents, knows them as with little dust on their
eves and with much dust on their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties,
with good behaviour and with bad behaviour, easy to teach and hard to teach,
12.	Bhanti—"they shine": this form is not given in PED under bhati.
13.	To take what is not self-evident in this paragraph, three kinds of feeling are pleasant,
painful and neither-painful-nor-pleasant (see MN 59). Four kinds of nutriment are physical

capable and incapable [of achievement] (cf. Patis I 121), therefore this world of
beings was known to him in all ways.
40. And as the world of beings so also the world of location. For accordingly
this [world measures as follows]:
One world-sphere14 is twelve hundred thousand leagues and thirty-four
hundred and fifty leagues (1,203,450) in breadth and width. In circumference,
however:
[The measure of it] all around]
Is six and thirty hundred thousand
And then ten thousand in addition,
Four hundred too less half a hundred (3,610,350).

nutriment, contact, mental volition, and consciousness (see M I 48, and M-a I 207f.).
The seven stations of consciousness are: (1) sense sphere, (2) Brahma's Retinue, (3)
Abhassara (Brahma-world) Deities, (4) Subhakinna (Brahma-world) Deities, (5) base
consisting of boundless space, (6) base consisting of boundless consciousness, (7)
base consisting of nothingness (see D III 253). The eight worldly states are gain, fame,
praise, pleasure, and their opposites (see D III 260). The nine abodes of beings: (1-4) as in
stations of consciousness, (5) unconscious beings, (6-9) the four immaterial states
(see D III 263). The ten bases are eye, ear, nose, tongue, body visible object, sound,
odour, flavour, tangible object.
14. Cakkavala (world-sphere or universe) is a term for the concept of a single complete
universe as one of an infinite number of such universes. This concept of the cosmos,
in its general form, is not peculiar to Buddhism, but appears to have been the already
generally accepted one. The term loka-dhatu (world-element), in its most restricted
sense, is one world-sphere, but it can be extended to mean any number, for example,
the set of world-spheres dominated by a particular Brahma (see MN 120).
As thus conceived, a circle of "world-sphere mountains" "like the rim of a wheel"
(cakka—Vism-mht 198) encloses the ocean. In the centre of the ocean stands Mount
Sineru (or Meru), surrounded by seven concentric rings of mountains separated by
rings of sea. In the ocean between the outermost of these seven rings and the enclosing
"world-sphere mountain" ring are the "four continents."
"Over for tv-two thousand leagues away" (Dhs-a 313) the moon and the sun circulate
above them inside the world-sphere mountain ring, and night is the effect of the sun's
going behind Sineru. The orbits of the moon and sun are in the sense-sphere heaven
of the Four Kings (Catumaharaja), the lowest heaven, which is a layer extending from
the world-sphere mountains to the slopes of Sineru. The stars are on both sides of
them (Dhs-a 318). Above that come the successive layers of the other five sense-
sphere heavens—the four highest not touching the earth—and above them the
fine-material Brahma-worlds, the higher of which extend over more than one world-
sphere (see A V 59). The world-sphere rests on water, which rests on air, which rests
on space. World-spheres "lie adjacent to each other in contact like bowls, leaving a
triangular unlit space between each three" (Vism-mht 199), called a "world-interspace"
(see too M-a IV 178). Their numbers extend thus in all four directions to infinity on the
supporting water's surface.
The southern continent of Jambudipa is the known inhabited world (but see e.g.
DN 26). Various hells (see e.g. MN 130; A V 173; Vin III 107) are below the earth's
surface. The lowest sensual-sphere heaven is that of the Deities of the Four Kings

Kumbhanda-raja (King of the South), Virtipaka Naga-raja (King of the West), and
Kuvera or Vessavana Yakkha-raja (King of the North—see DN 32). Here the moon
and sun circulate. The deities of this heaven are often at war with the Asura demons
(see e.g. D II 285) for possession of the lower slopes of Sineru. The next higher is
Tavatimsa (the Heaven of the Thirty-three), governed bv Sakka, Ruler of Gods (sukkn-
devinda). Above this is the heaven of the Yama Deities (Deities who have Gone to Bliss)
ruled by King Suyama (not to be confused with Yama King of the Underworld—see M
III 179). Higher still come the Deities of the Tusita (Contented) Heaven with King
Santusita. The fifth of these heavens is that of the Nimmanarati Deities (Deities who
Delight in Creating) ruled by King Sunimmita. The last and highest of the sensual-
sphere heavens is the Paranimmitavasavatti Heaven (Deities who Wield Power over
Others' Creations). Their king is Vasavatti (see A I 227; for details see Vibh-a 5191.).

band of brigands (M-a I 33f.). For destruction and renewal of all this at the end of the
aeon, see Ch. XIII.

from the foot of the world-sphere mountains down as far as the foot of Sineru, where
it measures in depth as much as Sineru's height. And Yugandhara, which is half that
height, rests on the earth as Isadhara and the rest do; for it is said: 'Bhikkhus, the
great ocean gradually slopes, gradually tends, gradually inclines' (Ud 53). Between
Sineru and Yugandhara and so on, the oceans are called 'bottomless' (sldanta). Their
widths correspond respectively to the heights of Sineru and the rest. The mountains
stand all round Sineru, enclosing it, as it were. Yugandhara surrounds Sineru, then

himself, there is no one to compare with him, thus he is incomparable. For in this
way he surpasses the whole world in the special quality of virtue, and also in the
special qualities of concentration, understanding, deliverance, and knowledge
and vision of deliverance. In the special quality of virtue he is without equal, he
is the equal onlv of those [other Enlightened Ones] without equal, he is without
like, without double, without counterpart; ... in the special quality of
knowledge and vision of deliverance he is ... without counterpart, according
as it is said: "I do not see in the world with its deities, its Maras and its
Brahmas, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmans, with its princes
and men,19 anyone more perfect in virtue than myself" (S I 139), with the rest in

men to be tamed (purisadammasarathi); he tames, he disciplines, is what is
meant. Herein, animal males (purisd) and human males, and non-human
males that are not tamed but fit to be tamed (dametum yuttd) are "men to be
tamed" (purisadamma). For the animal males, namely, the royal naga (serpent)
Apalala, Culodara, Mahodara, Aggisikha, Dhumasikha, the royal naga
Aravala, the elephant Dhanapalaka, and so on, were tamed by the Blessed
One, freed from the poison [of defilement] and established in the refuges and
the precepts of virtue; and also the human males, namely, Saccaka the
Niganthas' (Jains') son, the brahman student Ambattha, [208] Pokkharasati,
Sonadanda, Kutadanta, and so on; and also the non-human males, namely,
the spirits Alavaka, Suciloma and Kharaloma, Sakka Ruler of Gods, etc.,20
were tamed and disciplined by various disciplinary means. And the following
sutta should be given in full here: "I discipline men to be tamed sometimes
gently, Kesi, and I discipline them sometimes roughly, and I discipline them
sometimes gently and roughly" (A II 112).
48. Then the Blessed One moreover further tames those already tamed, doing
so by announcing the first jhana, etc., respectively to those whose virtue is
purified, etc., and also the way to the higher path to stream enterers, and so on.
19.	The rendering of sadevamanussanam by "with its princes and men" is supported
by the commentary. See M-a II 20 and also M-a I 33 where the use of samnmti-deva for
a royal personage, not an actual god is explained. Dev a is the normal mode of addressing
a king. Besides, the first half of the sentence deals with deities and it would be out of
place to refer to them again in the clause related to mankind.
20.	The references are these: Apalala (Maliavamsa, p. 242), "Dwelling in the Himalayas"
(Vism-mht 202), Culodara and Mahodara (Mhv pp. 7-8; Dip pp. 21-23), Aggisikha and
Dhumasikha ("Inhabitant of Sri Lanka"—Vism-mht 202), Aravala and Dhanapalaka
(Vin II194-96; J-a V 333-37), Saccaka (MN 35 and 36), Ambattha (DN 3), Pokkharasati
(D I 109), Sonadanda (DN 4), Kutadanta (DN 5), Alavaka (Sn p. 31), Suciloma and
Kharaloma (Sn p. 47f.), Sakka (D I 263f.).

Six Recollections
Or alternatively, the words incomparable leader of men to be tamed can be taken
together as one clause. For the Blessed One so guides men to be tamed that in a
single session they may go in the eight directions [by the eight liberations]
without hesitation. Thus he is called the incomparable leader of men to be tamed.
And the following sutta passage should be given in full here: "Guided by the
elephant-tamer, bhikkhus, the elephant to be tamed goes in one direction ..."
(M III 222).
[Teacher of Gods and Men]
49. He teaches (anusdsati) by means of the here and now, of the life to come, and
of the ultimate goal, according as befits the case, thus he is the Teacher (satthar).
And furthermore this meaning should be understood according to the Niddesa
thus: "Teacher (satthar)': the Blessed One is a caravan leader (satthar) since he
brings home caravans (sattha). Just as one who brings a caravan home gets
caravans across a wilderness, gets them across a robber-intested wilderness,
gets them across a wild-beast-infested wilderness, gets them across a foodless
wilderness, gets them across a waterless wilderness, gets them right across, gets
them quite across, gets them properly across, gets them to reach a land of safety,
so too the Blessed One is a caravan leader, one who brings home the caravans, he
gets them across a wilderness, gets them across the wilderness of birth" (Nidd
I 446).
50.	Of gods and men: devamanussanam - devanan ca manussdnan ca (resolution of
compound). This is said in order to denote those wh|o are the best and also to
denote those persons capable of progress. For the Blessed One as a teacher
bestowed his teaching upon animals as well. For when animals can, through
listening to the Blessed One's Dhamma, acquire the benefit of a [suitable rebirth
as] support [for progress], and with the benefit of that same support they come,
in their second or third rebirth, to partake of the path and its fruition.
51.	Manduka, the deity's son, and others illustrate this. While the Blessed One
was teaching the Dhamma to the inhabitants of the city of Campa on the banks
of the Gaggara Lake, it seems, a frog (manduka) apprehended a sign in the
Blessed One's voice. [209] A cowherd who was standing leaning on a stick put
his stick on the frog's head and crushed it. He died and was straight away
reborn in a gilded, divine palace, twelve leagues broad in the realm of the Thirty-
three (Tdvatimsa). He found himself there, as if waking up from sleep, amidst a
host of celestial nymphs, and he exclaimed, "So I have actually been reborn here.
What deed did I do?" When he sought for the reason, he found it was none other
than his apprehension of the sign in the Blessed One's voice. He went with his
divine palace at once to the Blessed One and paid homage at his feet. Though
the Blessed One knew about it, he asked him:
"Who now pays homage at my feet,
Shining with glory of success,
Illuminating all around
With beauty so outstanding?"
`204
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
"In mv last life I was a frog,
The waters of a pond my home;
A cowherd's crook ended my life
While listening to your Dliamma" (Vv 49).
The Blessed One taught him the Dhamma. Eiglity-four thousand creatures
gained penetration to the Dliamma. As soon as the deity's son became established
in the fruition of stream-entry he smiled and then vanished.
[Enlightened]
52. He is enlightened (buddha) with the knowledge that belongs to the fruit of
liberation, since everything that can be known has been discovered (buddha) by him.
Or alternatively he discovered (bujjhi) the four truths bv himself and awakened
(bodhesi) others to them, thus and for other such reasons he is enlightened
(buddha). And in order to explain this meaning the whole passage in the Niddesa
beginning thus: "He is the discoverer (bujjhitar) of the truths, thus he is
enlightened (buddha). He is the awakened (bodhetar) of the generation, thus he is
enlightened (buddha)'' (Nidd I 457), or the same passage from the Patisambhida
(Patis I 174), should be quoted in detail.
[Blessed]
53.	Blessed (bhagavant) is a term signifying |the respect and veneration accorded
to him as the highest of all beings and distinguished by his special qualities.21
Hence the Ancients said:
"Blessed" is the best of words,
"Blessed" is the finest word;
Deserving awe and veneration,
Blessed is the name therefore.
54.	Or alternatively names are of four kinds: denoting a period of life, describing
a particular mark, signifying a particular acquirement, and fortuitously arisen,22
which last in the current usage of the world is called "capricious." Herein, [210]
names denoting a period of life are those such as "yearling calf" (vaccha), "steer
to be trained" (damma), "yoke ox" (<balivaddha), and the like. Names describing a
particular mark are those such as "staff-bearer" (dandin), "umbrella-bearer"
(chattin), "topknot-wearer" (sikhin), "hand possessor" (karin—elephant), and
the like. Names signifying a particular acquirement are those such as "possessor of
the threefold clear vision" (tevijja), "possessor of the six direct-knowledges"
(chalabhinna), and the like. Such names are Sirivaddhaka ("Augmenter of
21.	For the breaking up of this compound cf. parallel passage at M-a I 10.
22.	Avattliika—"denoting a period in life" (from avattha, see IV167); not in PED; the
meaning given in the PED for lingika—"describing a particular mark," is hardly adequate
for this ref.; nemittika—"signifying a particular acquirement" is not in this sense in
PED. For more on names see Dhs-a 390.
23.	The commentarial name for the Elder Sariputta to whom the authorship of the
Patisambhida is traditionally attributed. The Patisambhida text has "Buddha," not
"Bhagava."

Chapter VII
Six Recollections
Lustre"), Dhanavaddhaka ("Augmenter of Wealth"), etc., are fortuitously arisen
names; they have no reference to the word-meanings.
55.	This name, Blessed, is one signifying a particular acquirement; it is not
made by Maha-Maya, or by King Suddhodana, or by the eighty thousand
kinsmen, or by distinguished deities like Sakka, Santusita, and others. And this
is said by the General of the Law:23 "'Blessed': this is not a name made by a
mother ... This [name] 'Buddha,' which signifies final liberation, is a realistic
description of Buddhas (Enlightened Ones), the Blessed Ones, together with
their obtainment of omniscient knowledge at the root of an Enlightenment [Tree]"
(Patis I 174; Nidd I 143).
56.	Now, in order to explain also the special qualities signified by this name
they cite the following stanza:
BhagJ bhajl bhagi vibhattavd iti
Akdsi bhaggan ti guru ti bhagyava
Bahuhi ndyehi subhavitattano
Bhavantago so bhagavd ti vuccati.
The reverend one (guru) has blessings (bhagi), is a frequenter (bhajl), a partaker
(bhagi), a possessor of what has been analyzed (vibhattavd);
He has caused abolishing (bhagga), he is fortunate (bhagyava),
He has fully developed himself (subhavitattano) in many ways;
He has gone to the end of becoming (bhavantago); thus| is called "Blessed"
(bhagavd).
The meaning of these words should be understood according to the method
of explanation given in the Niddesa (Nidd I 142).24
--
24. "The Niddesa method is this: The word Blessed (bhagavd) is a term of respect.
Moreover, he has abolished (bhagga) greed, thus he is blessed (bhagavd); he has
abolished hate, ... delusion, ... views, ... craving, ... defilement, thus he is blessed.
"'He divided (bltaji), analyzed (vibhaji), and classified (pativibhaji) the Dhamma
treasure, thus he is blessed (bliagavd). He makes an end of the kinds of becoming
(bhavdnam antakaroti), thus he is blessed (bhagavd). He has developed (bhdvita) the body
and virtue and the mind and understanding, thus he is blessed (bhagavd).
"'Or the Blessed One is a frequenter (bhajl) of remote jungle-thicket resting places
with little noise, with few voices, with a lonely atmosphere, where one can lie hidden
from people, favourable to retreat, thus he is blessed (bhagavd).
"'Or the Blessed One is a partaker (bhagi) of robes, alms food, resting place, and the
requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, thus he is blessed (bhagavd). Or he is a
partaker of the taste of meaning, the taste of the Law, the taste of deliverance, the
higher virtue, the higher consciousness, the higher under standing, thus he is blessed
(bhagavd). Or he is a partaker of the four jhanas, the four measureless states, the four
immaterial states, thus he is blessed. Or he is a partaker of the eight liberations, the
eight bases of mastery, the nine successive attainments, thus he is blessed. Or he is a
partaker of the ten developments of perception, the ten kasina attainments,
concentration due to mindfulness of breathing, the attainment due to foulness, thus
he is blessed. Or he is a partaker |of the ten powers of Perfect Ones (see MN 12), of the
`206
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
57.	But there is this other way:
Bhagyava bhaggava yutto bhagehi ca vibhattava.
Bhattava vanta-gamano bhavesu: bhagavd tato.
He is fortunate (bhagyava), possessed of abolishment (bhaggava), associated
with blessings (yutto bhagehi), and a possessor of what has been analyzed
(vibhattava).
He has frequented (bhattava), and he has rejected going in the kinds of
becoming (VAnta-GAmano BHAvesu), thus he is Blessed (Bhagava).
58.	Herein, by using the characteristic of language beginning with "vowel
augmentation of syllable, elision of syllable" (see Kdsika VI.3.109), or by using
the characteristic of insertion beginning with [the example of] pisodara, etc. (see
Panini, Ganapdtha 6,3,109), it may be known that he [can also] be called "blessed"
(bhagavd) when he can be called "fortunate" (bhagyava) owing to the
'O	y	'CTT7	'	o
fortunateness (bhagya) to have reached the further shore [of the ocean of
perfection] of giving, virtue, etc., which produce mundane and supramundane
bliss (See Khp-a 108.).
59. [Similarly], he [can also] be called "blessed" (bhagavd) when he can be
called "possessed of abolishment" (bhaggava) owing to the following menaces
having been abolished; for he has abolished (abhanji) all the hundred thousand
kinds of trouble, anxiety and defilement classed as greed, as hate, as delusion,
and as misdirected attention; as consciencelessness and shamelessness, as anger
and enmity as contempt and domineering, as envy and avarice, as deceit and
fraud, as obduracy and presumption, as pride and haughtiness, as vanity and
negligence, as craving and ignorance; as the three roots of the unprofitable,
kinds of misconduct, defilement, stains, [211] fictitious perceptions, applied
thoughts, and diversifications; as the four perversenesses, cankers, ties, floods,
bonds, bad ways, cravings, and clingings; as the five wildernesses in the heart,
shackles in the heart, hindrances, and kinds of delight; as the six roots of discord,
and groups of craving; as the seven inherent tendencies; as the eight
wrongnesses; as the nine things rooted in craving; as the ten courses of
unprofitable action; as the sixty-two kinds of [false] view; as the hundred and
eight ways of behaviour of craving25—or in brief, the five Maras, that is to say, the
four kinds of perfect confidence (ibid), of the four discriminations, of the six kinds of
direct knowledge, of the six Enlightened Ones' states [not shared by disciples (see note 7)],
thus he is blessed. Blessed One (bhagavd)'. this is not a name made by a mother ... This
name, Blessed One, is a designation based on realization'" (Vism-mht 207).
25. Here are explanations of those things in this list that cannot be discovered by
reference to the index: The pairs, "anger and enmity" to "conceit and negligence (MI
16). The "three roots" are greed, hate, and delusion (D III 214). The "three kinds of
misconduct" are that of body speech, and mind (S V 75). The "three defilements" are
misconduct, craving and views (Ch. 1.9,13). The "three erroneous perceptions" (visania-
saiind) are those connected with greed, hate, and delusion (Vibh 368). The three "applied
thoughts" are thoughts of sense-desire, ill will, and cruelty (M I 114). The "three
diversifications" (papafica) are those due to craving, conceit, and [false] views (XVI
n. 17). "Four perversenesses": seeing permanence, pleasure, self, and beauty where

Maras of defilement, of the aggregates, and of kamma-formations, Mara as a
deity, and Mara as death.
And in this context it is said:
He has abolished (bhagga) greed and hate,
Delusion too, he is canker-free;
Abolished every evil state,
"Blessed" his name may rightly be.
60. And by his fortunateness (bhdgyavatd) is indicated the excellence of his
material body which bears a hundred characteristics of merit; and by his having
abolished defects (bhaggadosata) is indicated the excellence of his Dhamma body.
Likewise, [bv his fortunateness is indicated] the esteem of worldly [people; and
by his having abolished defects, the esteem of] those who resemble him. [And by
_	^,-^xx.. Vxj ix	*TX^ x^^xx..^x^ xixxxi. ^xxi^i ^ ,
his fortunateness it is indicated] that he is fit to be relied on26 by laymen; and [bv
his having abolished defects that he is fit to be relied on by] those gone forth into
homelessness; and when both have relied on him, they acquire relief from bodily
and mental pain as well as help with both material and Dhamma gifts, and they
are rendered capable of finding both mundane and supramundane bliss.
61. He is also called "blessed" (bhagavd) since he is "associated with blessings"
(bhagehi yuttattd) such as those of the following kind, in the sense that he "has
those blessings" (bhagd assa santi). Now, in the world the word "blessing" is used
for six things, namely, lordship, Dhamma, fame, glory, wish, and endeavour. He
has supreme lordship over his own mind, either of the kind reckoned as mundane
and consisting in "minuteness, lightness," etc.,27 or that complete in all aspects,
and likewise the supramundane Dhamma. And he h|as exceedingly pure fame,
spread through the three worlds, acquired though the special quality of veracity.
And he has glory of all limbs, perfect in every aspect, which is capable of
comforting the eyes of people eager to see his material body And he has his wish,
in other words, the production of what is wanted, since whatever is wanted and
--
there is none (Vibh 376). "Four cankers," etc. (XXII.47ff.). "Five wildernesses" and
"shackles" (M I 101). "Five kinds of delight": delight in the five aggregates (XVI.93).
"Six roots of discord": anger, contempt, envy, fraud, evilness of wishes, and adherence
to one's own view (D III 246). "Nine things rooted in craving" (D III 288-89). "Ten
courses of unprofitable action": killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, slander,
harsh speech, gossip, covetousness, ill will, wrong view (M I 47, 286f.). "Sixty-two
kinds of view": (D I 12ff.; MN 102). "The hundred and eight ways of behaviour of
craving" (Vibh 400).
26.	Abhigamanlya—"fit to be relied on": abhigacchati not in PED.
27.	Vism-mht says the word "etc." includes the following six: rnahimd, patti, pakamma,
Jsitd, vasita, and yattliakdrnavasdyita. "Herein, anirnd means making the bodv minute (the
size of an atom—ami). Laghimd means lightness of body; walking on air, and so on.
Mahinid means enlargement producing hugeness of the body Patti means arriving
where one wants to go. Pakamma means producing what one wants by resolving, and
so on. Isitd means self-mastery lordship. Vasita means mastery of miraculous powers.
Yatthakamavasdyitd means attainment of perfection in all ways in one who goes through
the air or does anything else of the sort" (Vism-mht 210). Yogabhdsya 3.45.

needed bv him as beneficial to himself or others is then and there produced for
him. And he has the endeavour, in other words, the right effort, which is the
reason why the whole world venerates him.
62. [He can also] be called "blessed" (bhagavd) when he can be called "a possessor
of what has been analyzed" (vibhattavd) owing to his having analyzed [and
clarified] all states into the [three] classes beginning with the profitable; or
profitable, etc., states into such classes as aggregates, bases, elements, truths,
faculties, dependent origination, etc.; [212] or the noble truth of suffering into
the senses of oppressing, being formed, burning, and changing; and that of
origin into the senses of accumulating, source, bond, and impediment; and that
of cessation into the senses of escape, seclusion, being unformed, and deathless;
and that of the path into the senses of outlet, cause, seeing, and predominance.
Having analyzed, having revealed, having shown them, is what is meant.
63.	He [can also] be called "blessed" (bhagavd) when he can be called one who
"has frequented” (bhattava) owing to his having frequented (bhaji), cultivated,
repeatedly practiced, such mundane and supramundane higher-than-human
states as the heavenly the divine, and the noble abidings,28 as bodily, mental, and
existential seclusion, as the void, the desireless, and the signless liberations,
and others as well.
64.	He [can also] be called "blessed" (bhagavd) when he can be called one who
"has rejected going in the kinds of becoming” (vantagamano bhavesu) because in the
three kinds of becoming (bhava), the going (gamana), in other words, craving, has
been rejected (vanta) by him. And the syllables bha from the word bhava, and ga
from the word gamana, and va from the word vanta with the letter a lengthened,
make the word bhagavd, just as is done in the world [of the grammarians outside
the Dispensation] with the word mekhald (waist-girdle) since "garland for the
private parts" (MEhanassa KHAssa mdLA) can be said.
65.	As long as [the meditator] recollects the special qualities of the Buddha in
this way "For this and this reason the Blessed One is accomplished, ... for this
and this reason he is blessed," then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed
by greed, or obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his mind has rectitude on
that occasion, being inspired by the Perfect One" (A III 285).29
28.	The three "abidings" are these: heavenly abiding = kasina jhana, divine abiding
= loving-kindness jhana, etc., noble abiding = fruition attainment. For the three kinds
of seclusion, see IV note 23.
29.	Vism-mht adds seven more plays on the word bhagavd, which in brief are these:
he is bhagavd (a possessor of parts) because he has the Dhamma aggregates of virtue,
etc. (bhdgd = part, vant = possessor of). He is bhatavd (possessor of what is borne)
because he has borne (bliata) the perfections to their full development. He has cultivated
the parts (bhdge vani), that is, he has developed the various classes of attainments. He
has cultivated the blessings (bhage vani), that is, th|e mundane and supramundane
blessings. He is bhattava (possessor of devotees) because devoted (bhatta) people
show devotion (bliatti) to him on account of his attainments. He has rejected blessings
(bhage vami) such as glory lordship, fame and so on. He has rejected the parts (bhdge
vami) such as the five aggregates of experience, and so on (Vism-mht 241-46).
`209
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
66. So when he has thus suppressed the hindrances by preventing obsession
by greed, etc., and his mind faces the meditation subject with rectitude, then his
applied thought and sustained thought occur with a tendency toward the
Enlightened One's special qualities. As he continues to exercise applied thought
and sustained thought upon the Enlightened One's special qualities, happiness
arises in him. With his mind happy, with happiness as a proximate cause, his
bodily and mental disturbances are tranquilized by tranquillity When the
disturbances have been tranquilized, bodily and mental bliss arise in him. When
he is blissful, his mind, with the Enlightened One's special qualities for its
object, becomes concentrated, and so the jhana factors eventually arise in a
single moment. But owing to the profundity of the Enlightened One's special
qualities, or else owing to his being occupied in recollecting special qualities of
many sorts, the jhana is only access and does not reach absorption. And that
access jhana itself is known as "recollection of the Buddha" too, because it
arises with the recollection of the Enlightened One's special qualities as the
means.
67. When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Buddha, he is respectful
and deferential towards the Master. He attains fullness of faith, mindfulness,
understanding and merit. He has much happiness and gladness. He conquers
fear and dread. [213] He is able to endure pain. He comes to feel as if he were
living in the Master's presence. And his body, when the recollection of the
Buddha's special qualities dwells in it, becomes as worthy of veneration as a
shrine room. His mind tends toward the plane of the Buddhas. When he
encounters an opportunity for transgression, he has awareness of conscience
and shame as vivid as though he were face to face with the Master. And if he
penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny.
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Buddha
Blessed with such mighty potency
This, firstly is the section dealing with the recollection of the Enlightened
One in the detailed explanation.
[(2) Recollection of the Dhamma]
68. One who wants to develop the recollection of the Dhamma (Law) should go
into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of both the Dhamma (Law) of
the scriptures and the ninefold supramundane Dhamma (state) as follows:
As to the word "bhattava": at VII.63, it is explained as "one who has frequented
(bhaji) attainments." In this sense the attainments have been "frequented" (bhatta) by
him Vism-mht (214 f.). uses the same word in another sense as "possessor of
devotees," expanding it as bhatta dalhabhattika assa balm atthi\ ("he has many devoted
firm devotees"—Skr. bhakta). In PED under bhattavant (citing also Vism 212) only the
second meaning is given. Bhatta is from the same root (bhaj) in both cases.
For a short exposition of this recollection see commentary to AN 1:16.1.
`210
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
"The Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, visible here and now,
not delaved (timeless), inviting of inspection, onward-leading, and directly
experienceable bv the wise" (M I 37; A III 285).
[Well Proclaimed]
69. Well proclaimed: in this clause the Dhamma of the scriptures is included as
well as the other; in the rest of the clauses only the supramundane Dhamma is
included.
Herein, the Dhamma of the scriptures is well proclaimed because it is g|ood in the
beginning, the middle, and the end, and because it announces the life of purity that
is utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail (see M I 179).
Even a single stanza of the Blessed One's teaching is good in the beginning
with the first word, good in the middle with the second, third, etc., and good in
the end with the last word, because the Dhamma is altogether admirable. A
sutta with a single sequence of meaning30 is good in the beginning with the
introduction, good in the end with the conclusion, and good in the middle with
what is in between. A sutta with several sequences of meaning is good in the
beginning with the first sequence of meaning, good in the end with the last
sequence of meaning, and good in the middle with the sequences of meaning in
between. Furthermore, it is good in the beginning with the introduction [giving
the place of] and the origin [giving the reason for] its utterance. It is good in the
middle because it suits those susceptible of being taught since it is unequivocal
in meaning and reasoned with cause and example. It is good in the end with its
conclusion that inspires faith in the hearers.
70. Also the entire Dhamma of the Dispensation is good in the beginning with
virtue as one's own well-being. It is good in the middle with serenity and insight
and with path and fruition. It is good in the end with Nibbana. Or alternatively
it is good in the beginning with virtue and concentration. [214] It is good in the
middle with insight and the path. It is good in the end with fruition and Nibbana.
Or alternatively it is good in the beginning because it is the good discovery
made by the Buddha. It is good in the middle because it is the well-regulatedness
of the Dhamma. It is good in the end because it is the good wav entered upon by
the Sarigha. Or alternatively, it is good in the beginning as the discovery of what
can be attained by one who enters upon the way of practice in conformity after
hearing about it. It is good in the middle as the unproclaimed enlightenment [of
Paccekabuddhas]. It is good in the end as the enlightenment of disciples.
71. And when listened to, it does good through hearing it because it suppresses
the hindrances, thus it is good in the beginn|ing. And when made the way of
30. Anusandhi—"sequence of meaning": a technical commentarial term signifying
both a particular subject treated in a discourse, and also the way of linking one subject
with another in the same discourse. At M-a 1175 three kinds are distinguished: sequence
of meaning in answer to a question (pucchannsandhi—e.g. M I 36), that to suit a
personal idiosyncrasy (ajjhasayanusandhi—e.g. M I 23) and that due to the natural
course of the teaching (yatlianusandhi—e.g. the whole development of MN 6).
`211
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
practice it does good through the way being entered upon because it brings the
bliss of serenity and insight, thus it is good in the middle. And when it has thus
been made the way of practice and the fruit of the way is ready, it does good
through the fruit of the way because it brings [unshakable] equipoise, thus it is
good in the end.
So it is "well proclaimed" because of being good in the beginning, the middle
and the end.
72. Now, the life of purity that is to say, the life of purity of the Dispensation and
the life of purity of the path, which the Blessed One announces, which he shows
in various ways when he teaches the Dhamma, is "with meaning" because of
perfection of meaning, and it is "with detail" because of perfection of detail, as
it is proper that it should be. It is "with meaning" because it conforms to the
words declaring its meaning bv pronouncing, clarifying, revealing, expounding,
and explaining it. It is "with detail" because it has perfection of syllables, words,
-------r	n	-------------- ------------------r ^----— .--------,------,
details, style, language, and descriptions. It is "with meaning" owing to
profundity of meaning and profundity of penetration. It is "with detail" owing
to profundity of law and profundity of teaching. It is "with meaning" because it
is the province of the discriminations of meaning and of perspicuity. It is "with
detail" because it is the province of the discriminations of law and of language
(see XIV21). It is "with meaning" since it inspires confidence in persons of
discretion, being experienceable by the wise. It is "with detail" since it inspires
confidence in worldly persons, being a fit object of faith. It is "with meaning"
because its intention is profound. It is "with detail" because its words are clear.
It is "utterly perfect" with the complete perfection due to absence of anything
that can be added. It is "pure" with the immaculateness due to absence of
anything to be subtracted.
73. Furthermore, it is "with meaning" because it provides the particular
distinction31 of achievement through practice of the way, and it is "with detail"
because it provides the particular distinction of learning through mastery of
scripture. It is "utterly perfect" because it is connected [with the five
aggregates of Dhamma beginning with virtue.32 It is "pure" because it has
CTCT O	O----O	I
no imperfection, because it exists for the purpose of crossing over [the round
of rebirths' flood (see M I 134)], and because it is not concerned with worldly
things.
So it is "well proclaimed" because it "announces the life of purity that is
utterly perfect and pure with meaning and with detail."
Or alternatively it is well proclaimed since it has been properly proclaimed
with no perversion of meaning. For the meaning of other sectarians' law suffers
perversion since there is actually no obstruction in the [215] things described
there as obstructive and actually no outlet in the things described there as outlets,
--

32.	These "five aggregates" are those of virtue, concentration, understanding,
deliverance, and knowledge and vision of deliverance.
`212
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
which is why their law is ill-proclaimed; but not so the Blessed One's Law,
whose meaning suffers no perversion since the things described there as
obstructions and the things described there as outlets are so in actual fact.
So, in the first place, the Dhamma of the scriptures is "well proclaimed."
74.	The supramundane Dhamma is well proclaimed since both the way that
accords with Nibbana and the Nibbana that accords with the way have been
proclaimed, according as it is said: "The way leading to Nibbana has been
properly declared to the disciples by the Blessed One, and Nibbana and the way
meet. Just as the water of the Ganges meets and joins with the water of the
Yamuna, so too the wav leading to Nibbana] has been properly declared to the
disciples by the Blessed One, and Nibbana and the way meet" (D II 223).
75.	And here the noble path, which is the middle wav since it does not approach
either extreme, is well proclaimed in being proclaimed to be the middle way.
The fruits of asceticism, where defilements are tranquilized, are well proclaimed
too in being proclaimed to have tranquilized defilement.
Nibbana, whose individual essence is eternal, deathless, the refuge, the shelter,
etc., is well proclaimed too in being proclaimed to have an individual essence that
is eternal, and so on.
So the supramundane Dhamma is also "well proclaimed."
[Visible Here and Now]
76. Visible here and now: firstly, the noble path is "visible here and now" since it
can be seen by a noble person himself when he has done away with greed, etc.,
in his own continuity according as it is said: "When a man is dyed with greed,
brahman, and is overwhelmed and his mind is obsessed by greed, then he thinks
for his own affliction, he thinks for others' affliction, he thinks for the affliction
of both, and he experiences mental suffering and grief. When greed has been
abandoned, he neither thinks for his own affliction, nor thinks for others'
affliction, nor thinks for the affliction of both, and he does not experience mental
suffering and grief. This, brahman, is how the Dhamma is visible here and now"
(A I 156). [216]
77.	Furthermore, the ninefold supramundane Dhamma is also visible here and
now, since when anyone has attained it, it is visible to him through reviewing
knowledge without his having to rely on faith in another.
78.	Or alternatively the view (ditthi) that is recommended (pasattha—pp. of root
sums) is "proper view" (sanditthi). It conquers by means of proper view, thus it
"has proper view" (sanditthika—"visible here and now"). For in this way the
noble path conquers defilements by means of the proper view associated with it,
and the noble fruition does so by means of the proper view that is its cause, and
Nibbana does so by means of the proper view that has Nibbana as its objective
field. So the ninefold supramundane Dhamma "has the proper view"
(sanditthika—"is visible here and now") since it conquers bv means of proper
view, just as a charioteer (rathika) is so called because he conquers by means of
a chariot (ratha).
`213
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
79.	Or alternatively, it is seeing (dassana) that is called "the seen" (dittha);
then dittha and sandittha are identical in meaning as "seeing." It is worthy of
being seen (dittha), thus it is "visible here and now" (sanditthika). For the
supramundane Dhamma (law) arrests the fearful round [of kamma, etc.,] as
soon as it is seen by means of penetration consisting in development [of the
path] and by means of penetration consisting in realization [of Nibbana]. So
it is "visible here and now" (sanditthika) since it i|s worthy of being seen
(dittha), just as one who is clothable (vattihika)33 is so called because he is
worthy of clothes (vattha).
[Not Delayed]
80.	It has no delay (lit. "takes no time"—kdla) in the matter of giving its own
fruit, thus it is "without delay" (akdla). "Without delay" is the same as "not
delayed" (akdlika). What is meant is that instead of giving its fruit after creating
a delay (using up time), say five days, seven days, it gives its fruit immediately
next to its own occurrence (see Sn 226).
81.	Or alternatively, what is delayed (kdlika—lit. "what takes time") is what
needs some distant34 time to be reached before it can give its fruit. What is that?
It is the mundane law of profitable [kamma]. This, however, is undelayed (na
kdlika) because its fruit comes immediately next to it, so it is "not delayed"
(akdlika).
This is said with reference to the path.
[Inviting of Inspection]
82.	It is worthy of an invitation to inspect (ehipassa-vidhi) given thus: "Come
and see this Dhamma" (ehi passa imam dhammam), thus it is "inviting of
inspection" (ehipassika). But why is it worthy of this invitation? Because it is
found and because of its purity. For if a man has said that there is money or gold
in an empty fist, he cannot say, "Come and see it." Why not? Because it is not
found. And on the other hand, while dung or urine may well be found, a man
cannot, for the purpose of cheering the mind by exhibiting beauty say "Come
--
33.	Vatthika—"clothable"; not in PED.
34.	Pakattha—"distant"; not in PED (= dura—Vism-mht 297).
35.	This passage is only loosely renderable because the exegesis here is based
almost entirely on the substitution of one Pali grammatical form for another (padasiddhi).
The reading opaneyyiko (for opanayiko) does not appear in any Sinhalese text (generally
the most reliable); consequently the sentence "opanayiko va opaneyyiko" (see Harvard
text) is absent in them, being superfluous. Vism-mht's explanations are incorporated.
This paragraph depends on the double sense of upaneti (npa + neti, to lead on or
induce) and its derivatives as (i) an attractive inducement and (ii) a reliable guide, and
so the word induce is stretched a bit and inducive coined on the analogy of conducive.
Upanaya (inducement) is not in PED, nor is upanayana (inducing) in this sense (see also
XIV68). Upanayana means in logic "application," "subsumption"; and also upanetabba
means "to be added"; see end of §72. For allvyana ("treating as one's shelter") see
references in Glossary.
`214
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
and see this;" on the contrary, thev have to be covered up with grass and leaves.
Why? Because of their impurity. But this ninefold supramundane Dhamma is
actually found as such in its individual essence, and it is as pure as the full
moon's disk in a cloudless sky, as a gem of pure water on bleached cloth. [217]
Consequently, it is worthy of the invitation to inspect since it is found and pure,
thus it is "inviting of inspection."
[Onward-Leading]
83. The word opanayika ("onward-leading") is [equivalent to the gerund]
upanetabba ("ought to—can—be induced"). Here is an exposition. An inducing
(upanayana) is an inducement (upanaya), [As the four paths and four fruitions]
this [Dhamma] is worth inducing (upanayanam arahati) [that is, arousing] in
one's own mind [subjectively] by means of development, without any question
of whether or not one's clothing or one's head is on fire (see A IV 320), thus it is
"onward-leading" (opanayika). This applies to the [above-mentioned eight]
formed supramundane states (dhammas). But the unformed [dhamma] is worth
inducing by one's own mind [to become the mind's object], thus it is "onward-
leading," too; the meaning is that it is worth treating as one's shelter by
realizing it.
84.	Or alternatively, what induces (upaneti) [the noble person] onwards to
Nibbana is the noble path, which is thus inductive (upaneyya). Again, what can
(ought to) be induced (upanetabba) to realizability is the Dhamma consisting in
fruition and Nibbana, which is thus inductive (upaneyya), too. The word upaneyya
is the same as the word opanayika.35
[Is Directly Experienceable by the Wise]
85.	Is directly experienceable by the wise: it can be experienced by all the kinds of
wise men beginning with the "acutely wise" (see A II 135) each in himself thus:
"The path has been developed, fruition attained, and cessation realized, by me."
For it does not happen that when a preceptor has developed the path his co-
resident abandons his defilements, nor does a co-resident dwell in comfort owing
to the preceptor's attainment of fruition, nor does he realize the Nibbana realized
by the preceptor. So this is not visible in the wav that an ornament on another's
head is, but rather it is visible only in one's own mind. What is meant is that it
can be undergone by wise men, but it is not the province of fools.
86.	Now, in addition, this Dhamma is well proclaimed. Why? Because it is
visible here and now. It is visible here and now because it is not delayed. It is not
delayed because it invites inspection. And what invites inspection is onward-
leading.
87.	As long as [the meditator] recollects the special qualities of the Dhamma in
this way then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed
by hate, or obsessed bv delusion; his mind has rectitude on that occasion, being
inspired by the Dhamma" (A III 285).
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhana factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing to the
`215
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
profundity of the Dhamma's special qualities, or else owing to his being occupied
in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the jhana is only access and does
not reach absorption. And that access jhana itself is known as "recollection of
the Dhamma" too because it arises with the recollection of the Dhamma's special
qualities as the means.
88. [218] When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Dhamma, he
thinks: "I never in the past met a master who taught a law t|hat led onward thus,
who possessed this talent, nor do I now see any such a master other than the
Blessed One." Seeing the Dhamma's special qualities in this way, he is respectful
and deferential towards the Master. He entertains great reverence for the
Dhamma and attains fullness of faith, and so on. He has much happiness and
gladness. He conquers fear and dread. He is able to endure pain. He comes to
feel as if he were living in the Dhamma's presence. And his body when the
recollection of the Dhamma's special qualities dwells in it, becomes as worthy of
veneration as a shrine room. His mind tends towards the realization of the peerless
Dhamma. When he encounters an opportunity for transgression, he has vivid
awareness of conscience and shame on recollecting the well-regulatedness of
the Dhamma. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy
destiny.
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Dliamma
Blessed with such mighty potency.
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Dhamma in the detailed
explanation.
[(3) Recollection of the Sangha]
89. One who wants to develop the recollection of the Community should go
into solitary retreat and recollect the special qualities of the community of Noble
Ones as follows:
"The community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the good way
the community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the straight way,
the community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the true way, the
community of the Blessed One's disciples has entered on the proper way, that is
to say, the four pairs of men, the eight persons; this community of the Blessed
One's disciples is fit for gifts, fit for hospitality, fit for offerings, fit for reverential
salutation, as an incomparable field of merit for the world" (A III 286).
[Entered on the Good, Straight, True, Proper Way]
90. Herein, entered on the good way (supatipanna) is thoroughly entered on the
way (sutthu patipanna). What is meant is that it has entered on a way (patipanna)
that is the right way (samma-patipada), the way that is irreversible, the way that is
in conformity [with truth], the way that has no opposition, the way that is
regulated by the Dhamma. They hear (sunanti) attentively the Blessed One's
instruction, thus thev are his disciples (savaka—lit. "hearers|"). The community of
`216
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
the disciples is the community of those disciples. The meaning is that the total of
disciples forms a comnxunality because it possesses in common both virtue and
[right] view. [219] That right way being straight, unbent, uncrooked, unwarped,
is called noble and true and is known as proper owing to its becomingness,
therefore the noble community that has entered on that is also said to have entered
on the straight way, entered on the true way, and entered on the proper way.
91.	Those who stand on the path can be understood to have entered on the good
way since they possess the right way. And those who stand in fruition can be
understood to have entered on the good way with respect to the way that is now
past since by means of the right way they have realized what should be realized.
92.	Furthermore, the Community has entered on the good way because it has
entered on the way according as instructed in the well-proclaimed Dhamma
and Discipline (dhamma-vinaya), and because it has entered on the immaculate
way. It has entered on the straight way because it has entered on the way avoiding
the two extremes and taking the middle course, and because it has entered on
the way of the abandonment of the faults of bodily and verbal crookedness,
tortuousness and warpedness. It has entered on the true way because Nibbana is
what is called "true" and it has entered on the wav with that as its aim. It has
entered on the proper way because it has entered on the way of those who are
worthy of proper acts [of veneration].
93. The word yadidam ("that is to say") = ydni imani. The four pairs of men:
taking them pairwise, the one who stands on the first path and the one who
stands in the first fruition as one pair, in this way there are four pairs. The eight
persons: taking them bv persons, the one who stands on the first path as one and
the one who stands in the first fruition as one, in this way there are eight persons.
And there in the compound purisa-puggala (persons) the words purisa and puggala
have the same meaning, but it is expressed in| this way to suit differing
susceptibility to teaching.
This community of the Blessed One's disciples: this community of the Blessed
One's disciples taken by pairs as the four pairs of men (purisa) and individually
as the eight persons (purisa-puggala).
[Fit for Gifts]
94.	As to fit for gifts, etc.: what should be brought (dnetvd) and given (hunitabba)
is a gift (dhuna—lit. "sacrifice"); the meaning is, what is to be brought even from
far away and donated to the virtuous. It is a term for the four requisites. The
Community is fit to receive that gift (sacrifice) because it makes it bear great fruit,
thus it is "fit for gifts" (dhuneyya).
95.	Or alternatively all kinds of property even when the bringer comes (dgantvd)
from far away can be given (hunitabba) here, thus the Community "can be given
to" (dhavanlya); or it is fit to be given to by Sakka and others, thus it "can be given
to." And the brahmans' fire is called "to be given (sacrificed) to" (dhavanlya), for
thev believe that what is sacrificed to it brings great fruit. [220] But if something
is to be sacrificed to for the sake of the great fruit brought by what is sacrificed to
`217
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
it, then surely the Community should be sacrificed to; for what is sacrificed
(given) to the Community has great fruit, according as it is said:
"Were anyone to serve the fire
Out in the woods a hundred years,
And pay one moment's homage too
To men of self-development,
His homage would by far excel
His hundred years of sacrifice" (Dhp 107).
And the words dhavanlya ("to be sacrificed to"), which is used in the schools,36
is the same in meaning as this word dhuneyya ("fit for gifts") used here. There is
only the mere trifling difference of syllables. So it is "fit for gifts."
[Fit for Hospitality]
96. Fit for hospitality (pdhuneyya): "hospitality" (pdhuna) is what a donation to
'	'"'•''-'J-'.......V	x^yxxvvxx^T \^'	v i
visitors is called, prepared with all honours for the sake of dear and beloved
relatives and friends who have come from all quarters. But even more than to
such objects of hospitality it is fitting that it should be given also to the Community;
for there is no object of hospitality so fit to receive hospitality as the Community
since it is encountered after an interval between Buddhas and possesses wholly
endearing and lovable qualities. So it is "fit for hospitality" since the hospitality
is fit to be given to it and it is fit to receive it.
But those who take the text to be pahavaniya ("fit to be given hospitality to")
have it that the Community is worthy to be placed first and so what is to be given
should first of all be brought here and given (sabba-Pathamam Anetvd ettha
HUNitabbam), and for that reason it is "fit to be given hospitality to" (pahavaniya)
or since it is worthy to be given to in all aspects (sabba-Pakdrena AHAVANAm
arahati), it is thus "fit to be given hospitality to" (pahavaniya). And here this is
called pdhuneyya in the same sense.
[Fit for Offering]
97. "Offering" (dakkhina) is what a gift is called that is to be given out of faith
---------1? *.........• ' .........-------------------- t?----------— .......
in the world to come. The Community is worthy of that offering, or it is helpful to
that offering because it purifies it by making it of great fruit, thus it is fit for
offerings (dakkhineyya).
[Fit for Salutation]
It is worthy of being accorded by the whole world the reverential salutation
(anjali-kamma) consisting in placing both hands [palms together] above the head,
thus it is fit for reverential salutation (anjalikaramya).
[As an Incomparable Field of Merit for the World]
98. As an incomparable field of merit for the world: as a place without equal in the
world for growing merit; just as the place for growing the king's or minister's
36. "In the Sarvastivadin school and so 011" (Vism-mlit 230).
`218
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
rice or corn is the king's rice-field or the king's corn-field, so the Community is
the place for growing the whole world's merit. For the world's various kinds of
merit leading to welfare and happiness grow with the Community as their
support. Therefore the Community is "an incomparable field of merit for the
world."
99. As long as he recollects the special qualities of the Sangha in this way,
classed as "having entered on the good way" etc., [221] then: "On that occasion
his mind is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed bv hate, or obsessed by delusion;
his mind has rectitude on that occasion, being inspired by the Sangha" (A III
286).
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhana factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing to the
profundity of the Community's special qualities, or else owing to his being
occupied in recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the jhana is only access
------r----... ---------- o T	I	----7	'---- /	-----/ -----
and does not reach absorption. And that access jhana itself is known as
"recollection of the Sangha" too because it arises with the recollection of the
Community's special qualities as the means.
100. When a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of the Community he is
respectful and deferential towards the Community. He attains fullness of faith,
and so on. He has much happiness and bliss. He conquers fear and dread. He is
able to endure pain. He comes to feel as if he were living in the Community's
presence. And his body, when the recollection of the Sangha's special qualities
dwells in it, becomes as worthy of veneration as an Uposatha house where the
Communitv has met. His mind tends towards the attainment of the Community's
special qualities. When he encounters an opportunity for transgression, he has
awareness of conscience and shame as vividly as if he were face to face with the
Communitv. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy
destiny.
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of the Sangha
Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of the Community in the
detailed explanation.
[(4) Recollection of Virtue]
101. One who wants to develop the recollection of virtue should go into solitary
retreat and recollect his own different kinds of virtue in their special qualities of
being untorn, etc., as follows:
Indeed, my various kinds of virtue are "untorn, unrent, unblotched, unmottled,
liberating, praised by the wise, not adhered to, and conducive to concentration"
(A III 286). And a lavman should recollect them in the form of laymen's virtue
while one gone forth into homelessness should recollect them in the form of the
virtue of those gone forth.
`219
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
102.	Whether thev are the virtues of laymen or of those gone forth, when no
one of them is broken in the beginning or in the end, not being torn like a cloth
ragged at the ends, then they are untorn. [222] When no one of them is broken in
the middle, not being rent like a cloth that is punctured in the middle, then they
are unrent. When they are not broken twice or thrice in succession, not being
blotched like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with
discrepant-coloured oblong or round patch appearing on her back or belly then
they are unblotched. When they are not broken all over at intervals, not being
mottled like a cow speckled with discrepant-coloured spots, then they are
unmottled.
103.	Or in general they are untorn, unrent, unblotched, unmottled when they are
undamaged by the seven bonds of sexuality (1.144) and by anger and enmity
and the other evil things (see §59).
104.	Those same virtues are liberating since they liberate by freeing from the
--- -------------- --------— -----^ -------_ ----------------o----------
slavery of craving. They are praised by the wise because they are praised by such
wise men as Enlightened Ones. They are not adhered to (aparamattha) since they
are not adhered to (apardniatthattd) with craving and [false] view, or because of
the impossibility of misapprehending (pardmatthum) that "There is this flaw in
your virtues." Thev are conducive to concentration since they conduce to access
concentration and absorption concentration, or to path concentration and fruition
concentration.
105. As long as he recollects his own virtues in their special qualities of being
untorn, etc., in this way then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by
greed, or obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion, his mind has rectitude on
that occasion, being inspired by virtue" (A III 286).
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhana factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing to the
profundity of the virtues' special qualities, or owing to his being occupied in
recollecting special qualities of many sorts, the jhana is only access and does
not reach absorption. And that access jhana itself is known as "recollection of
virtue" too because it arises with the virtues' special qualities as the means.
106. And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of virtue, he has respect
for the training. He lives in communion [with his fellows in the life of purity]. He
is sedulous in welcoming. He is devoid of the fear of self-reproach and so on. He
sees fear in the slightest fault. He attains fullness of faith, and so on. He has
much happiness and gladness. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least
headed for a happy destiny
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of his virtue
Blessed with such mighty potency.
This is the section dealing with the recollection of virtue in the detailed
explanation. [223]|
`220
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
[(5) Recollection of Generosity]
107. One who wants to develop the recollection of generosity should be
naturally devoted to generosity and the constant practice of giving and sharing.
Or alternatively if he is one who is starting the development of it, he should
make the resolution: "From now on, when there is anyone present to receive, I
shall not eat even a single mouthful without having given a gift." And that very
day he should give a gift by sharing according to his means and his ability with
those who have distinguished qualities. When he has apprehended the sign in
that, he should go into solitary retreat and recollect his own generosity in its
special qualities of being free from the stain of avarice, etc., as follows:
"It is gain for me, it is great gain for me, that in a generation obsessed by the
stain of avarice I abide with my heart free from stain by avarice, and am freely
generous and open-handed, that I delight in relinquishing, expect to be asked,
and rejoice in giving and sharing" (A III 287).
108.	Herein, it is gain for me: it is my gain, advantage. The intention is: I surely
partake of those kinds of gain for a giver that have been commended by the
Blessed One as follows: "A man who gives life [by giving food] shall have life
either divine or human" (A III 42), and: "A giver is loved and frequented by
many" (A III 40), and: "One who gives is ever loved, according to the wise man's
law" (A III 41), and so on.
109.	It is great gain for me: it is great gain for me that this Dispensation, or the
human state, has been gained by me. Why? Because of the fact that "I abide with
my mind free from stain by avarice ... and rejoice in giving and sharing."
110.	Herein, obsessed by the stain of avarice is overwhelmed by the stain of avarice.
Generation: beings, so called owing to the fact of their being generated. So the
meaning here is this: among beings who are overwhelmed by the stain of avarice,
which is one of the dark states that corrupt the [natural] transparency of
consciousness (see A I 10) and which has the characteristic of inability to bear
sharing one's own good fortune with others.
111.	Free from stain by avarice because of being both free from avarice and from
the other stains, greed, hate, and the rest. I abide with my heart: I abide with my
consciousness of the kind already stated, is the meaning. [224] But in the sutta,
"I live the home life with my heart free" (A III 287; V 331), etc., is said because it
was taught there as a [mental] abiding to depend on [constantly] to Mahanama
the Sakyan, who was a stream-enterer asking about an abiding to depend on.
There the meaning is "I live overcoming ..."
112. Freeh/ generous: liberally generous. Open-handed: with hands that are
purified. What is meant is: with hands that are always washed in order to give
gifts carefully with one's own hands. That I delight in relinquishing: the act of
relinquishing (vossajjana) is relinquishing (vossagga); the meaning is, giving up.
To delight in relinquishing is to delight in constant devotion to that relinquishing.
Expect to he asked (yacayoga): accustomed to being asked (yacana-yogga) because
of giving whatever others ask for, is the meaning. Yajayoga is a reading, in
which case the meaning is: devoted (yutto) to sacrifice (yaja), in other words, to
`221
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
sacrificing (yajana). And rejoice in sharing: the meaning is, he recollects thus: "I
give gifts and I share out what is to be used by myself, and I rejoice in both."
113. As long as he recollects his own generosity in its special qualities of
freedom from stain by avarice, etc., in this way then: "On that occasion his mind
is not obsessed by greed, or obsessed by hate, or obsessed by delusion; his mind
has rectitude on that occasion, being inspired by generosity" (A III 287).
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already described
(§66), the jhana factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing to the
profundity of the generosity's special qualities, or owing to his being occupied
in recollecting the generosity's special qualities of many sorts, the jhana is onlv
access and does not reach absorption. And that access jhana is known as
"recollection of generosity" too because it arises with the generosity's special
qualities as the means.
114.	And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of generosity, he
becomes ever more intent on generosity, his preference is for non-greed, he acts
in conformity with loving-kindness, he is fearless. He has much happiness and
gladness. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy
destiny
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of his giving
Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of generosity in the detailed
explanation. [225]
[(6) Recollection of Deities]
115.	One who wants to develop the recollection of deities shoul|d possess the
special qualities of faith, etc., evoked bv means of the noble path, and he should
go into solitary retreat and recollect his own special qualities of faith, etc., with
deities standing as witnesses, as follows:
"There are deities of the Realm of the Four Kings (deva cdtnmmahdrdjika),
there are deities of the Realm of the Thirty-three (deva tavatimsa), there are deities
who are Gone to Divine Bliss (yama)... who are Contented (tusitd)... who Delight
in Creating (nimmdnarati) ... who Wield Power Over Others' Creations
(paranimmitavasavatti), there are deities of Brahma's Retinue (brahmakayika), there
are deities higher than that. And those deities were possessed of faith such that
on dying here they were reborn there, and such faith is present in me too. And
those deities were possessed of virtue ... of learning ... of generosity ... of
understanding such that when they died here they were reborn there, and such
understanding is present in me too" (A III 287).
116. In the sutta, however, it is said: "On the occasion, Malianama, on which a
noble disciple recollects the faith, the virtue, the learning, the generosity, and the
understanding that are both his own and of those deities," on that occasion his
mind is not obsessed by greed ..." (A III 287). Although this is said, it should
`222
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
nevertheless be understood as said for the purpose of showing that the special
qualities of faith, etc., in oneself are those in the deities, making the deities stand
as witnesses. For it is said definitely in the Commentary: "He recollects his own
special qualities, making the deities stand as witnesses."
117. As long as in the prior stage he recollects the deities' special qualities of
faith, etc., and in the later stage he recollects the special qualities of faith, etc.,
existing in himself, then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed,
or obsessed by hate, or obsessed bv delusion, his mind has rectitude on that
occasion, being inspired by deities" (A III 288).
So when he has suppressed the hindrances in the way already stated (§66),
the jhana factors arise in a single conscious moment. But owing to the profundity
of the special qualities of faith, etc., or owing to his being occupied in recollecting
special qualities of many sorts, the jhana is only access and does not reach
absorption. And that access jhana itself is known as "recollection of deities" too
because it arises with the deities special qualities as the means. [226]
118.	And when a bhikkhu is devoted to this recollection of deities, he becomes
dearly loved by deities. He obtains even greater fullness of faith. He has much
happiness and gladness. And if he penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for
a happy destiny
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection of deities
Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of deities in the detailed
explanation.
[General]
119.	Now, in setting forth the detail of these recollections, after the words, "His
mind has rectitude on that occasion, being inspired by the| Perfect One," it is
added: "When a noble disciple's mind has rectitude, Malianama, the meaning
inspires him, the law inspires him, and the application of the law makes him
- — V -I- *-"	—— -*- vcrrxx^vc^^x. —	xxiwx*^ xlxxxi
glad. When he is glad, happiness is born in him" (A III 285-88). Herein, the
meaning inspires him should be understood as said of contentment inspired by
the meaning beginning, "This Blessed One is such since he is ..." (§2). The law
inspires him is said of contentment inspired by the text. The application of the law
makes him glad is said of both (cf. M-a I 173).
120.	And when in the case of the recollection of deities inspired by deities is
said, this should be understood as said either of the consciousness that occurs
in the prior stage inspired bv deities or of the consciousness [that occurs in the
later stage] inspired by the special qualities that are similar to those of the deities
and are productive of the deities' state (cf. §117).
121.	These six recollections succeed only in noble disciples. For the special
qualities of the Enlightened One, the Law, and the Community are evident to
them; and they possess the virtue with the special qualities of untornness, etc.,
`223
Chapter VII
Six Recollections
the generosity that is free from stain by avarice, and the special qualities of faith,
etc., similar to those of deities.
122.	And in the Mahanama Sutta (A III 285 f.) they are expounded in detail bv
the Blessed One in order to show a stream-winner an abiding to depend upon
when he asked for one.
123.	Also in the Gedha Sutta they are expounded in order that a noble disciple
should purify his consciousness by means of the recollections and so attain
further purification in the ultimate sense thus: "Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple
recollects the Perfect One in this way: That Blessed One is such since he is
accomplished ... His mind has rectitude on that occasion. He has renounced,
[227] got free from, emerged from cupidity. Cupidity bhikkhus, is a term for the
five cords of sense desire. Some beings gain purity here by making this
[recollection] their prop" (A III 312).
124.	And in the Sambadhokasa Sutta taught by the venerable Maha-Kaccana
they are expounded as the realization of the wide-open through the susceptibility
of purification that exists in the ultimate sense only in a noble disciple thus: "It
is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous how the realization of the wide-open in the
crowded [house life] has been discovered by the Blessed One who knows and
sees, accomplished and fully enlightened, for the purification of beings, [for the
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the ending of pain and grief, for the
attainment of the true wav], for the realization of Nibbana, that is to say the six
stations of recollection. What six? Here, friends, a noble disciple recollects the
Perfect One ... Some beings are susceptible to purification in this way" (A III
314-15).
125.	Also in the Uposatha Sutta they are expounded in order to show the
greatness of the fruit of the Uposatha, as a mind-purifying meditation subject for
a noble disciple who is observing the Uposatha: "And what is the Noble Ones'
Uposatha, Visakha? It is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by
imperfections. And what is the gradual cleansing of the mind still sullied by
imperfections? Here, Visakha, a noble disciple recollects the Perfect One ..." (A
I 206-11).
126.	And in the Book of Elevens, when a noble disciple has asked, "Venerable
sir, in what way should we abide who abide in various ways?" (A V 328), they
are expounded to him in order to show the way of abiding in this wav: "One
who has faith is successful, Mahanama, not one who has no faith. One who is
energetic ... One whose mindfulness is established ... One who is concentrated
... One who has understanding is successful, Mahanama, not one who has no
understanding. Having established vourself in these five things, Mahanama,
you should develop six things. H|ere, Mahanama, you should recollect the Perfect
One: That Blessed One is such since ..." (A V 329-32).
127.	Still, though this is so, they can be brought to mind by an ordinary man
too, if he possesses the special qualities of purified virtue, and the rest. [228] For
when he is recollecting the special qualities of the Buddha, etc., even only
according to hearsay his consciousness settles down, by virtue of which the
hindrances are suppressed. In his supreme gladness he initiates insight, and
`224
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
he even attains to Arahantship, like the Elder Phussadeva who dwelt at
Katakandhakara.
128. That venerable one, it seems, saw a figure of the Enlightened One created
by Mara. He thought, "How good this appears despite its having greed, hate
and delusion! What can the Blessed One's goodness have been like? For he was
quite without greed, hate and delusion!" He acquired happiness with the Blessed
One as object, and by augmenting his insight he reached Arahantship.

[(7) Mindfulness of Death]
1.	[229] Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of death,
which was listed next (III.105).
[Definitions]
Herein, death (;marana) is the interruption of the life faculty included within [the
limits of] a single becoming (existence). But death as termination (cutting off), in
other words, the Arahant's termination of the suffering of the round, is not
intended here, nor is momentary death, in other words, the momentary dissolution
of formations, nor the "death" of conventional (metaphorical) usage in such
expressions as "dead tree," "dead metal," and so on.
2.	As intended here it is of two kinds, that is to sav, timely death and untimely
death. Herein, timely death comes about with the exhaustion of merit or with the
exhaustion of a life span or with both. Untimely death comes about through
kamma that interrupts [other, life-producing] kamma.
3.	Herein, death through exhaustion of merit is a term for the kind of death that
comes about owing to the result of [former] rebirth-producing kamma's having
finished ripening although favourable conditions for prolonging the continuity
of a life span may be still present. Death through exhaustion of a life span is a term
for the kind of death that comes about owing to the exhaustion of the normal life
span of men of today which measures onlv a century owing to want of such
excellence in destiny [as deities have] or in time [as there is at the beginning of
an aeon] or in nutriment [as the Uttarakurus and so on have].1 Untimely death is
a term for the death of those whose continuity is interrupted by kamma capable
of causing them to fall (cavana) from their place at that very moment, as in the
case of Dusi-Mara (see M I 337), Kalaburaja (see J-a III 39), etc.,2 or for the death
of those whose [life's] continuity is interrupted by assaults with weapons, etc.,
due to previous kamma. [230] All these are included under the interruption of

236). See A-a II104, and M-a IV 8.
`226
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
the life faculty of the kinds already stated. So mindfulness of death is the
remembering of death, in other words, of the interruption of the life faculty
[Development]
4.	One who wants to develop this should go into solitary retreat and exercise
attention wisely in this way: "Death will take place; the life faculty will be
interrupted," or "Death, death."
5.	If he exercises his attention unwisely in recollecting the [possible] death of
an agreeable person, sorrow arises, as in a mother on recollecting the death of
her beloved child she bore; and gladness arises in recollecting the death of a
disagreeable person, as in enemies on recollecting the death of their enemies;
and no sense of urgency arises on recollecting the death of neutral people, as
happens in a corpse-bnrner on seeing a dead body; and anxiety arises on
recollecting one's own death, as happens in a timid person on seeing a murderer
with a poised dagger.
6.	hi all that there is neither mindfulness nor sense of urgency nor knowledge. So
he should look here and there at beings that have been killed or have died, and
advert to the death of beings already dead but formerly seen enjoving good tilings,
doing so with mindfulness, with a sense of urgency and with knowledge, after
which he can exercise his attention in the way beginning, "Death will take place."
Bv so doing he exercises it wisely He exercises it as a [right] means, is the meaning.3
7.	When some exercise it merely in this way, their hindrances get suppressed,
their mindfulness becomes established with de|ath as its object, and the meditation
subject reaches access.
[Eight Ways of Recollecting Death]
8.	But one who finds that it does not get so far should do his recollecting of
death in eight ways, that is to say: (1) as having the appearance of a murderer, (2)
as the ruin of success, (3) by comparison. (4) as to sharing the body with many
(5) as to the frailty of life, (6) as signless, (7) as to the limitedness of the extent, (8)
as to the shortness of the moment.
9.	1. Herein, as having the appearance of a murderer: he should do his recollecting
thus, "Just as a murderer appears with a sword, thinking, T shall cut this man's
head off/ and applies it to his neck, so death appears." Why? Because it comes
with birth and it takes away life.
10.	As budding toadstools always come up lifting dust on their tops, so beings
are born along with aging and death. For accordingly their rebirth-linking
consciousness reaches aging immediately next to its| arising and then breaks
up together with its associated aggregates, like a stone that falls from the summit
of a rock. [231] So to begin with, momentary death comes along with birth. But
death is inevitable for what is born; consequently the kind of death intended
here also comes along with birth.
3. For the expression upaya-manasikara—"attention as a [right] means" see M-a I 64.
`227

11.	Therefore, just as the risen sun moves on towards its setting and never
turns back even for a little while from wherever it has got to, or just as a mountain
torrent sweeps by with a rapid current, ever flowing and rushing on and never
turning back even for a little while, so too this living being travels on towards
death from the time when he is born, and he never turns back even for a little
while. Hence it is said:
"Right from the very day a man
Has been conceived inside a womb
He cannot but go on and on,
Nor going can he once turn back" (J-a IV 494).
12.	And whilst he goes on thus death is as near to him as drying up is to
rivulets in the summer heat, as falling is to the fruits of trees when the sap
reaches their attachments in the morning, as breaking is to clay pots tapped by
a mallet, as vanishing is to dewdrops touched by the sun's rays. Hence it is said:
"The nights and days go slipping by
As life keeps dwindling steadily
Till mortals' span, like water pools
In failing rills, is all used up" (S I 109).
"As there is fear, when fruits are ripe,
That in the morning thev will fall,
So mortals are in constant fear,
When they are born, that thev will die.
And as the fate of pots of clay
Once fashioned by the potter's hand,
Or small or big or baked or raw,4
Condemns them to be broken up,
So mortals]' life leads but to death" (Sn p. 576f.).
"The dewdrop on the blade of grass
Vanishes when the sun comes up;
Such is a human span of life:
So, mother, do not hinder me" (J-a IV 122).
13.	So this death, which comes along with birth, is like a murderer with poised
sword. And like the murderer who applies the sword to the neck, it carries off life
and never returns to bring it back. [232] That is why, since death appears like a
murderer with poised sword owing to its coming along with birth and carrying
off life, it should be recollected as "having the appearance of a murderer."
14.	2. As the ruin of success: here success shines as long as failure does not
overcome it. And the success does not exist that might endure out of reach of
failure. Accordingly:
"He gave with joy a hundred millions
After conquering all the earth,
Till in the end his realm came down
4. This line is not in the Sutta-nipata, but see D II120, note.
`228
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
To less than half a gall-nut's worth.
Yet when his merit was used up,
His body breathing its last breath,
The Sorrowless Asoka too5
Felt sorrow face to face with death."
15. Furthermore, all health ends in sickness, all youth ends in aging, all life
ends in death; all worldly existence is procured by birth, haunted by aging,
surprised by sickness, and struck d|own by death. Hence it is said:
"As though huge mountains made of rock
So vast thev reached up to the sky
Were to advance from every side,
Grinding beneath them all that lives,
So age and death roll over all,
Warriors, priests, merchants, and craftsmen,
The on teas tes and the scavengers,
Crushing all beings, sparing none.
And here no troops of elephants,
No charioteers, no infantry,
No strategy in form of spells,
No riches, serve to beat them off" (S I 102).
This is how death should be recollected as the "ruin of success" by defining
it as death's final ruining of life's success.
16.	3. By comparison: bv comparing oneself to others. Herein, death should be
recollected by comparison in seven ways, that is to say: with those of great fame,
with those of great merit, with those of great strength, with those of great
supernormal power, with those of great understanding, with Paccekabuddhas,
with fully enlightened Buddhas. How? [233]
17.	Although Mahasammata, Mandhatu, Mahasudassana, Dalhanemi, Nimi,6
etc.,7 were greatly famous and had a great following, and though they had
amassed enormous wealth, yet death inevitably caught up with them at length,
so how shall it not at length overtake me?
Great kings like Mahasammata,
Whose fame did spread so mightily,
All fell into death's power too;
What can be said of those like me?
5.	The Emperor Asoka is referred to. His name Asoka means "Sorrowless." This
story is in the Asokavadana and Divycivadana, pp. 429-434.
6.	The references for the names here and in the following paragraphs are:
Mahasammata (J-a III 454; II 311), Mandhatu (J-a II 311), Mahasudassana (D II 169f.),

It should be recollected in this way, firstly, by comparison with those of great
fame.
18.	How by comparison with those of great merit?
Jotika, Jatila, Ugga,
And Mjendaka, and Punnaka
These, the world said, and others too,
Did live most meritoriously;
Yet they came one and all to death;
What can be said of those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great merit.
19.	How by comparison with those of great strength?
Vasudeva, Baladeva,
Bhlmasena, Yuddhitthila,
And Canura the wrestler,
Were in the Exterminator's power.
Throughout the world they were renowned
As blessed with strength so mighty;
They too went to the realm of death;
What can be said of those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great strength.
20. How by comparison with those of great supernormal power?
The second of the chief disciples,
The foremost in miraculous powers,
Who with the point of his great toe
Did rock Vejayanta's Paljace towers,
Like a deer in a lion's jaw, he too,
Despite miraculous potency
Fell in the dreadful jaws of death;
What can be said of those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great
supernormal power.
21. How by comparison with those of great understanding? [234]
The first of the two chief disciples
Did so excel in wisdom's art
That, save the Helper of the World,
No being is worth his sixteenth part.
But though so great was Sariputta's
Understanding faculty
He fell into death's power too;
What can be said of those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with those of great
understanding.
`230
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
22. How by comparison with Paccekabuddhas? Even those who by the strength
of their own knowledge and energy crushed all the enemy defilements and
reached enlightenment for themselves, who [stood alone] like the horn of the
rhinoceros (see Sn p. 35f.), who were self-perfected, were still not free from death.
So how should I be free from it?
To help them in their search for truth
The Sages various signs employed,
Their knowledge brought them self-perfection,
Their cankers were at length destroyed.
Like the rhinoceros's horn
They lived alone in constancy
But death they could no way evade;
What can be said of those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with Paccekabuddhas.
23. How by comparison with fully enlightened Buddhas? Even the Blessed One,
whose material body was embellished with the eighty lesser details and adorned
with the thirtv-two marks of a great man (see MN 91; DN 30), whose Dhamma
body brought to perfection the treasured qualities of the aggregates of virtue,
etc.,8 made pure in everv aspect, who overpassed greatness of fame, greatness of
merit, greatness of strength, greatness of supernormal power and greatness of
understanding, who had no equal, who was the equal of those without equal,
without double, accomplished and fully enlightened—even he was suddenly
quenched by the downpour of death's rain, as a great mass of fire is quenched by
the downpour of a rain of water.
And so the Greatest Sage possessed
Such mighty power in every way,
And it was not through fear or guilt
That over him Death held his sway.
No being, not even one without
Guilt or pusillanimity
But will be smitten down; so how I
Will he not conquer those like me?
It should be recollected in this way by comparison with fully enlightened
Buddhas.
24.	When he does his recollecting in this way by comparing himself with
others possessed of such great fame, etc., in the light of the universality of death,
thinking, "Death will come to me even as it did to those distinguished beings,"
then his meditation subject reaches access. This is how death should be recollected
by comparison. [235]
25.	4. As to the sharing of the body with many: this body is shared by many. Firstly,
it is shared by the eighty families of worms. There too, creatures live in dependence
--
8. Virtue, concentration, understanding, deliverance, knowledge, and vision of
deliverance.
`231
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
on the outer skin, feeding on the outer skin; creatures live in dependence on the
inner skin, feeding on the inner skin; creatures live in dependence on the flesh,
feeding on the flesh; creatures live in dependence on the sinews, feeding on the
sinews; creatures live in dependence on the bones, feeding on the bones; and
creatures live in dependence on the marrow, [feeding on the marrow. And there
they are born, grow old and die, evacuate, and make water; and the body is their
maternity home, their hospital, their charnel-ground, their privy and their urinal.
The body can also be brought to death with the upsetting of these worms. And
just as it is shared with the eighty families of worms, so too it is shared by the
several hundred internal diseases, as well as by such external causes of death as
snakes, scorpions, and what not.
26. And just as when a target is set up at a crossroads and then arrows, spears,
pikes, stones, etc., come from all directions and fall upon it, so too all kinds of
accidents befall the body and it also comes to death through these accidents
befalling it. Hence the Blessed One said: "Here, bhikkhus, when day is departing
and night is drawing on,9 a bhikkhu considers thus: 'In many ways I can risk
death. A snake may bite me, or a scorpion may sting me, or a centipede may sting
me. I might die of that, and that would set me back. Or I might stumble and fall,
or the food I have eaten might disagree with me, or my bile might get upset, or my
phlegm might get upset [and sever my joints as it were] like knives. I might die of
that, and that would set me back'" (A III 306).
That is how death should be recollected as to sharing the body with many.
27.	5. As to the frailty of life: this life is impotent and frail. For the life of beings
is bound up with breathing, it is bound up with the postures, it is bound up with
cold and heat, it is bound up with the primary elements, and it is bound up with
nutriment.
28.	Life occurs only when the in-breaths and out-breaths occur evenly. But
when the wind in the nostrils that has gone outside does not go in again, or
when that which has gone inside does not come out again, then a man is
reckoned to be dead.
And it occurs only when the four postures are found occurring evenly. [236]
But with the prevailing of anyone of them the life process is interrupted.
And it occurs only when cold and heat are found occurring evenly. But it fails
when a man is overcome by excessive cold or heat.
And it occurs onlv when the four primary elements are found occurring
evenly But with] the disturbance of the earth element even a strong man's life can
be terminated if his body becomes rigid, or with the disturbance of one of the
elements beginning with water if his body becomes flaccid and petrified with a
flux of the bowels, etc., or if he is consumed by a bad fever, or if he suffers a
severing of his limb-joint ligatures (cf. XI.102).

`232
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
And life occurs only in one who gets physical nutriment at the proper time;
but if he gets none, he uses his life up.
This is how death should be recollected as to the frailty of life.
29.	6. As signless: as indefinable. The meaning is that it is unpredictable. For in
the case of all beings:
The span, the sickness, and the time, and where
The body will be laid, the destiny:
The living world can never know10 these things;
There is no sign foretells when they will be.
30.	Herein, firstly the span has no sign because there is no definition such as:
Just so much must be lived, no more than that. For beings [die in the various
stages of the embryo, namely], at the time of the kalala, of the abbuda, of the pesi, of
the ghana, at one month gone, two months gone, three months gone, four months
gone, five months gone ... ten months gone, and on the occasion of coming out
of the womb. And after that they die this side or the other of the century.
31.	And the sickness has no sign because there is no definition such as: Beings
die onlv of this sickness, not of any other. For beings die of eye disease or of any
one among those beginning with ear disease (see A V 110).
32.	And the time has no sign because there is no definition such as: One has to
die onlv at this time, not at anv other. For beings die in the morning and at any of
the other times such as noon.
33.	And where the body will be laid down has no sign because there is no
definition such as: When people die, they must drop their bodies only here, not
anywhere else. For the person of those born inside a village is dropped outside
the village, and that of those born outside the village is dropped inside it. Likewise
that of those born in water is dropped on land, and that of those born on land in
water. And this can be multiplied in many ways. [237]
34.	And the destiny has no sign because there is no definition such as: One who
dies there must be reborn here. For there are some who die in a divine world and are
reborn in the human world, and there are some who die in the human world and are
reborn in a divine world, and so on. And in this way the world goes rotmd and
round the five kinds of destinies like an ox harnessed to a machine.
This is how death should be recollected as signless.
35. 7. As to the limitedness of the extent: the extent of human life is short now. One
who lives long lives a hundred years, more or less. Hence the Blessed One said:
"Bhikkhus, this human life span is short. There is a new life to be gone to, there
are profitable [deeds] to be done, there is the life of purity to be led. There is no
not dying for the born. He who lives long lives a hundred years, more or less ..."
"The life of humankind is short;
A wise man holds it in contempt
And acts as one whose head is burning;
Death will never fail to come" (S I 108).

And he said further: "Bhikkhus, there was once a teacher called Araka ..." (A
IV 136), all of which sutta should be given in full, adorned as it is with seven
similes.
36. And he said further: "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of
death thus, 'Oh, let me live a night and day that I may attend to the Blessed One's
teaching, surely much could be done by me,' and when a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of death thus, 'Oh, let me live a day that I may attend to the Blessed
One's teaching, surely much could be done by me/ and when a bhikkhu develops
mindfulness of death thus, 'Oh, let me live as long as it takes to chew and
swallow four or five mouthfuls that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching,
surely much could be done by me'—these are called bhikkhus who dwell in
negligence and slackly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of
cankers. [238]
37.	"And, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus,
'Oh, let me live for as long as it takes to chew and swallow a single mouthful that
I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much could be done by me/
and when a bhikkhu develops mindfulness of death thus, 'Oh, let me live as
long as it takes to breathe in and breathe out, or as long as it takes to breathe out
and breathe in, that I may attend to the Blessed One's teaching, surely much
could be done by me'—these are called bhikkhus who dwell in diligence and
keenly develop mindfulness of death for the destruction of cankers" (A III 305-6).
38.	So short in fact is the extent of life that it is not certain even for as long as it
takes to chew and swallow four or five mouthfuls.
This is how death should be recollected as to the limitedness of the extent.
39.	8. As to the shortness of\the moment: in the ultimate sense the life-moment of
living beings is extremely short, being only as much as the occurrence of a
single conscious moment. Just as a chariot wheel, when it is rolling, rolls [that
is, touches the ground] onlv on one point of [the circumference of] its tire, and,
when it is at rest, rests only on one point, so too, the life of living beings lasts
onlv for a single conscious moment. When that consciousness has ceased, the
being is said to have ceased, according as it is said: "In a past conscious moment
he did live, not he does live, not he will live. In a future conscious moment not he
did live, not he does live, he will live. In the present conscious moment not he did
live, he does live, not he will live."
"Life, person, pleasure, pain—just these alone
Join in one conscious moment that flicks by.
Ceased aggregates of those dead or alive
Are all alike, gone never to return.
No [world is] born if [consciousness is] not
Produced; when that is present, then it lives;
When consciousness dissolves, the world is dead:
The highest sense this concept wil|l allow"11 (Nidd I 42).
11. "'Person' (atta-bhava) is the states other than the already-mentioned life, feeling
and consciousness. The words 'just these alone' mean that it is unmixed with self (attd)
`234
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
or permanence" (Vism-mht 242). Atta-bhava as used in the Suttas and in this work is
more or less a synonym for sakkdya in the sense of person (body and mind) or
personality or individual form. See Pitaka refs|. in PED and e.g. this chapter §35 and
XI.54.
"'When consciousness dissolvesthe world is dead": just as in the case of the death-
consciousness, this world is also called 'dead' in the highest (ultimate) sense with the
arrival of anv consciousness whatever at its dissolution, since its cessation has no
rebirth-linking (is 'cessation never to return'). Nevertheless, though this is so, 'the
highest sense this concept will allow (pannatti paramatthiya)'—the ultimate sense will
allow this concept of continuity which is what the expression of common usage 'Tissa
lives, Phussa lives' refers to, and which is based on consciousnesses [momentarily]
existing along with a physical support; this belongs to the ultimate sense here, since,
as thev say, 'It is not the name and surname that lives.'" (Vism-mht 242, 801)
Something may be said about the word pannatti here. Twenty-four kinds are dealt
with in the commentary to the Puggalapannatti. The Puggalapannatti Schedule (mdtika)
gives the following six pannatti (here a making known, a setting out): of aggregates,
bases, elements, truths, faculties, and persons. (Pug 1) The commentary explains the
word in this sense as pannapana (making known) and thapana (placing), quoting "He
announces, teaches, declares (paniiapeti), establishes" (cf. M III 248), and also "a well-
appointed (supafmatta) bed and chair" (?). It continues: "The making known of a name
(ndma-pannatti) shows such and such dhammas and places them in such and such
compartments, while the making known of the aggregates (kliandlia-pannatti) and the
rest shows in brief the individual form of those making-known (pannatti)."
It then gives six kinds of pannatti "according to the commentarial method but not
in the texts": (1) Concept of the existent (vijjamana-paniiatti), which is the conceptualizing
of (making known) a dhamma that is existent, actual, become, in the true and ultimate
sense (e.g. aggregates, etc.). (2) Concept of the non-existent, which is, for example, the
conceptualizing of "female," "male," "persons," etc., which are non-existent by that
standard and are only established by means of current speech in the world; similarly
"such impossibilities as concepts of a fifth truth or the other sectarians' Atom,
Primordial Essence, World Soul, and the like." (3) Concept of the non-existent based on
the existent, e.g. the expression, "One with the three clear-visions," where the "person"
("one") is nonexistent and the "clear-visions" are existent. (4) Concept of the existent
based on the non-existent, e.g. the "female form," "visible form" (= visible datum base)
being existent and "female" non-existent. (5) Concept of the existent based on the
existent, e.g. "eye-contact," both "eye" and "contact" being existent. (6) Concept of the
non-existent based on the non-existent, e.g. "banker's son," both being non-existent.
Again two more sets of six are given as "according to the Teachers, but not in the
Commentaries." The first is: (1) Derivative concept (upddd-pannatti); this, for instance,
is a "being," which is a convention derived from the aggregates of materiality, feeling,
etc., though it has no individual essence of its own apprehendable in the true ultimate
sense, as materiality, say has in its self-identity and its otherness from feeling, etc.; or
a "house" or a "fist" or an "oven" as apart from its component parts, or a "pitcher" or
a "garment," which are all derived from those same aggregates; or "time" or
"direction," which are derived from the revolutions of the moon and sun; or the
"learning sign" or "counterpart sign" founded on some aspect or other, which are a
convention derived from some real sign as a benefit of meditative development: these
are derived concepts, and this kind is a "concept" (pannatti) in the sense of "ability to

Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
This is how death should be recollected as to the shortness of the moment.
[Conclusion]
40. So while he does his recollecting by means of one or other of these eight
ways, his consciousness acquires [the support of] repetition owing to the
reiterated attention, mindfulness settles down with death as its object, the
hindrances are suppressed, and the jhana factors make their appearance. But
since the object is stated with individual essences,12 and since it awakens a sense
of urgency, the jhana does not reach absorption and is only access. [239] Now,
with special development, the supramundane jhana and the second and the
fourth immaterial jhanas reach absorption even with respect to states with
individual essences. For the supramundane reaches absorption by means of

be set up" (pafmapetabba = ability to be conceptualized), but not in the sense of "making
known" (panndpana). Under the latter heading this would be a "concept of the
nonexistent." (2) Appositional concept (upa-nidhd-p.): many varieties are listed, namely,
apposition of reference ("second" as against "first," "third" as against "second,"
"long" as against "short"); apposition of what is in the hand ("umbrella-in-hand,"
"knife-in-hand"); apposition of association ("earring-wearer," "topknot-wearer,"
"crest-wearer"); apposition of contents ("corn-wagon," "ghee-pot"); apposition of
proximity ("Indasala Cave," "Piyarigu Cave"); apposition of comparison ("golden
coloured," "with a bull's gait"); apposition of majority ("Padumassara-brahman
Village"); apposition of distinction ("diamond ring"); and so on. (3) Collective concept
(samodhdna-p.), e.g., "eight-footed," "pile of riches." (4) Additive concept (upanikkhitta-
p.), e.g. "one," "two," "three." (5) Verisimilar concept (tajja-p.): refers to the individual
essence of a given dhamma, e.g. "earth," "fire," "hardness," "heat." (6) Continuity
concept (santati-p.): refers to the length of continuity of life, e.g. "octogenarian,"
"nonagenarian."
In the second set there are: (i) Concept according to function (kicca-p.), e.g. "preacher,"
"expounder of Dhamma." (ii) Concept according to shape (;santhana-p.), e.g. "thin," "stout,"
"round," "square." (iii) Concept according to gender (linga-p.), e.g. "female," "male." (iv)
Concept according to location (bhumi-p.), e.g. "of the sense sphere," "Kosalan." (v) Concept
as proper name (paccatta-p.), e.g. "Tissa," "Naga,I" "Sumana," which are making-known
(appellations) by mere name-making, (vi) Concept of the unformed (asankhata-pannatti),
e.g. "cessation," "Nibbana," etc., which make the unformed dhamma known—an
existent concept. (From commentary to Puggalapannatti, condensed—see also Dhs-a
390f.)
All this shows that the word pannatti carries the meanings of either appellation or
concept or both together, and that no English word quite corresponds.
12. "'But since the object is stated with individual essences': the breakup of states
with individual essences, their destruction, their fall—[all] that has to do only with
states with individual essences. Hence the Blessed One said: 'Bhikkhus, aging-and-
death is impermanent, formed, dependency arisen' (S II 26). ... If it cannot reach
absorption because of [its object being] states with individual essences then what
about the supramundane jhanas and certain of the immaterial jhanas? It was to answer
this that he said 'now with special development the supramundane jhana' and so on"
(Vism-mht 243). Kasina jhana, for example, has a concept (pannatti) as its object
(IV29) and a concept is a dhamma without individual essence (asabhava-dhamma).
`236
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
progressive development of the purification and the immaterial jhanas do so by
means of development consisting in the surmounting of the object (see Ch. X)
since there [in those two immaterial jhanas] there is merely the surmounting of
the object of jhana that had already reached absorption. But here [in mundane
mindfulness of death] there is neither so the jhana onlv reaches access. And that
access is known as "mindfulness of death" too since it arises through its means.
41. A bhikkhu devoted to mindfulness of death is constantly diligent. He
acquires perception of disenchantment with all kinds of becoming (existence).
He conquers attachment to life. He condemns evil. He avoids much storing. He
has no stain of avarice about requisites. Perception of impermanence grows in
him, following upon which there appear the perceptions of pain and not-self.
But while beings who have not developed [mindfulness of] death fall victims to
fear, horror and confusion at the time of death as though suddenly seized by
wild beasts, spirits, snakes, robbers, or murderers, he dies undeluded and fearless
without falling into any such state. And if he does not attain the deathless here
and now, he is at least headed for a happy destiny on the breakup of the body.
Now, when a man is truly wise,
His constant task will surely be
This recollection about death
Blessed with such mighty potency
This is the section dealing with the recollection of death in the detailed
explanation.
[(8) Mindfulness Occupied with the Body]
42. Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness occupied
with the body as a meditation subject, which is never promulgated except after
an Enlightened One's arising, and is outside the province of anv sectarians. It
has been commended by the Blessed One in various ways in different suttas
thus: "Bhikkhus, when one thing is developed and repeatedly practiced, it leads
to a supreme sense of urgency to supreme benefit, to supreme surcease of bondage,
to supreme mindfulness and full awareness, to acquisition of knowledge and
I	r ~	1	O
vision, to a happy life here and now, to realization of the fruit of clear vision and
deliverance. What is that one thing? It is mindfulness occupied with the body"
(A 143). And thus: "Bhikkhus, they savour the deathless who savour mindfulness
occupied with the body; they do not savour the deathless who do not savour
mindfulness occupied with the body.13 [240] They have savoured the deathless
who have savoured mindfulness occupied with the body; they have not savoured
... They have neglected ... they have not neglected ... They have missed ... they
have found the deathless who have found mindfulness occupied with the body"
(A I 45). And it has been described in fourteen sections in the passage beginning,
"And how developed, bhikkhus, how repeatedly practiced is mindfulness
occupied with the body of great fruit, of great benefit? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu,
gone to the forest ..." (M III 89), that is to say, the sections on breathing, on

`237
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
postures, on the four kinds of full awareness, on attention directed to
repulsiveness, on attention directed to elements, and on the nine charnel-ground
contemplations.
43. Herein, the three, that is to say the sections on postures, on the four kinds of
full awareness (see M-a I 253f.), and on attention directed to elements, as they are
stated [in that sutta], deal with insight. Then the nine sections on the charnel-
ground contemplations, as stated there, deal with that particular phase of insight
knowledge called contemplation of danger. And any development of
concentration in the bloated, etc., that might be implied there has already been
explained in the Description of Foulness (Ch. VI). So there are only the two, that
is, the sections on breathing and on directing attention to repulsiveness, that, as
stated there, deal with concentration. Of these two, the section on breathing is a
separate meditation subject, namely, mindfulness of breathing.
[Text]
44.	What is intended here as mindfulness occupied with the body is the thirty-
two aspects. This meditation subject is taught as the direction of attention to
repulsiveness thus: "Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this body, up from the
soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and contained in the skin, as
full of many kinds of filth thus: In this body there are head hairs, body hairs,
nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidney heart, liver, midriff,
spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat,
tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine" (M III 90), the brain being
included in the bone marrow in this version [with a total of only thirty-one aspects].
45.	Here is the description of the development introduced bv a commentary on
the text.
[Word Commentary]
This body: this filthy body constructed out of the four primary elements. Up front
the soles of the feet: from the soles of the feet upwards. Down from the top of the hair:
from the highest part of the hair downwards. Contained in the skin: terminated all
round by the skin. Reviews ... as full of many kinds of filth: [241] he sees that this
body is packed with the filth of various kinds beginning with head hairs. How?
"In this bodv there are head hairs ... urine."
46. Herein, there are means, there are found. I11 this: in this, which is expressed
thus: "Up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair and
contained in the skin, as full of many kinds of filth." Body: the carcass; for it is
the carcass that is called "body" (kdya) because it is a conglomeration of filth,
because such vile (kucchita) things as the head hairs, etc., and the hundred
diseases beginning with eye disease, have it as their origin {aya).
Head hairs;, body hairs: these things beginning with head hairs are the thirty-
two aspects. The construction here should be understood in this way: In this
body there are head hairs, in this body there are body hairs.
`238
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
47.	No one who searches throughout the whole of this fathom-long carcass,
starting upwards from the soles of the feet, starting downwards from the top of
the head, and starting from the skin all round, ever finds even the minutest atom
at all beautiful in it, such as a pearl, or a gem, or beryl, or aloes,14 or saffron, or
camphor, or talcum powder; on the contrary he finds nothing but the various
very malodorous, offensive, drab-looking sorts of filth consisting of the head
hairs, body hairs, and the rest. Hence it is said: "In this body there are head
hairs, body hairs ... urine."
This is the commentary on the word-construction here.
[Development]
48.	Now, a clansman who, as a beginner, wants to develop this meditation
subject should go to a good friend of the kind already described (111.61-73) and
learn it. And the teacher who expounds it to him should tell him the sevenfold
skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving attention.
[The Sevenfold Skill in Learning]
Herein, the sevenfold skill in learning should be told thus: (1) as verbal recitation,
(2) as mental recitation, (3) as to colour, (4) as to shape, (5) as to direction, (6) as
to location, (7) as to delimitation.
49. 1. This meditation subject consists in giving attention to repulsiveness.
Even if one is master of the Tipitaka, the verbal recitation should still be done at
the time of first giving it attention. For the meditation subject only becomes
evident to some through recitation, as it did to the two elders who learned the
meditation subject from the Elder Maha Deva of the Hill Country (Malava). On
being asked for the meditation subject, it seems, the elder [242] gave the text of
the thirty-two aspects, saying, "Do| only this recitation for four months."
Although they were familiar respectively with two and three Pitakas, it was only
at the end of four months of recitation of the meditation subject that thev became
stream-enterers, with right apprehension [of the text]. So the teacher who expounds
the meditation subject should tell the pupil to do the recitation verbally first.
50.	Now, when he does the recitation, he should divide it up into the "skin
pentad," etc., and do it forwards and backwards. After saying "Head hairs,
body hairs, nails, teeth, skin," he should repeat it backwards, "Skin, teeth, nails,
body hairs, head hairs."
51.	Next to that, with the "kidney pentad," after saying "Flesh, sinews, bones,
bone marrow, kidney" he should repeat it backwards, "Kidney, bone marrow,
bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, bod|v hairs, head hairs."
52.	Next, with the "lungs pentad," after saying "Heart, liver, midriff, spleen,
lungs," he should repeat it backwards, "Lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney
bone marrow, bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."
--
14. Agaru—"aloes": not so spelled in PED; but see again.
`239
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
53.	Next, with the "brain pentad," after saying "Bowels, entrails, gorge, dung,
brain," he should repeat it backwards, "Brain, dung, gorge, entrails, bowels;
lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney bone marrow, bones, sinews, flesh;
skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."
54.	Next, with the "fat sextad," after saying "Bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat,
fat," he should repeat it backwards, "Fat, sweat, blood, pus, phlegm, bile; brain,
dung, gorge, entrails, bowels; lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney bone
marrow, bones, sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs."
55.	Next, with the "urine sextad," after saving "Tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil
of the joints, urine," he should repeat it backwards, "Urine, oil of the joints, snot,
spittle, grease, tears; fat, sweat, blood, pus, phlegm, bile; brain, dung, gorge,
entrails, bowels; lungs, spleen, midriff, liver, heart; kidney bone marrow, bones,
sinews, flesh; skin, teeth, nails, body hairs, head hairs." [243]
56.	The recitation should be done verbally in this way a hundred times, a
thousand times, even a hundred thousand times. For it is through verbal recitation
that the meditation subject becomes familiar, and the mind being thus prevented
from running here and there, the parts become evident and seem like [the fingers
of] a pair of clasped hands,15 like a row of fence posts.
57.	2. The mental recitation should be done just as it is done verbally. For the
verbal recitation is a condition for the mental recitation, and the mental recitation
is a condition for the penetration of the characteristic [of foulness].16
58.	3. As to colour: the colour of the head hairs, etc., should be defined.
4.	As to shape: their shape should be defined too.
5.	As to direction: in this body, upwards from the navel is the upward direction,
and downwards from it is the downward direction. So the direction should be
defined thus: "This part is in this direction."
6.	As to location: the location of this or that part should be defined thus: "This
part is established in this location."
59.	7. As to delimitation: there are two kinds of delimitation, that is, delimitation
of the similar and delimitation of the dissimilar. Herein, delimitation of the
similar should be understood in this way: "This part is delimited above and
below and around by this." Delimitation of the dissimilar should be understood
as non-intermixed-ness in this way: "Head hairs are not body hairs, and body
hairs are not head hairs."
60. When the teacher tells the skill in learning in seven ways thus, he should
do so knowing that in certain suttas this meditation subject is expounded from
the point of view of repulsiveness and in certain suttas from the point of view of
elements. For in the Maha Satipatthana Sutta (DN 22) it is expounded only as
repulsiveness. In the Maha Hatthipadopama Sutta (MN 28), in the Maha
--
15.	Hatthasanklialikd—"the fingers of a pair of clasped hands," "a row of fingers
(angidipanti) (Vism-mht 246).
16.	"For the penetration of the characteristic of foulness, for the observation of
repulsiveness as the individual essence" (Vism-mht 246).
`240
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
Rahulovada Sutta (MN 62), and the Dhatuvibhanga (MN 140, also Vibh 82), it
is expounded as elements. In the Kayagatasati Sutta (MN 119), however, four
jhanas are expounded with reference to one to whom it has appeared as a
colour [kasina] (see III.107). Herein, it is an insight meditation subject that is
expounded as elements and a serenity meditation subject that is expounded as
repulsiveness. Consequently it is only the serenity meditation subject [that is
relevant] here.
[The Tenfold Skill in Giving Attention]
61. Having thus told the sevenfold skill in learning, he should tell the tenfold
skill in giving attention as follows: (1) as to following the order, (2) not too
quickly (3) not too slowly (4) as to warding off distraction, (5) as to surmounting
the concept, (6) as to successive leaving, (7) as to absorption, (8)-(10) as to the
three suttantas.
62.	1. Herein, as to following the order, from the time of beginning the recitation
[244] attention should be given following the serial order without skipping. For
just as when someone who has no skill climbs a thirty-two-rung ladder using
every other step, his body gets exhausted and he falls without completing the
climb, so too, one who gives it attention skipping [parts] becomes exhausted in
his mind and does not complete the development since he fails to get the
satisfaction that ought to be got with successful development.
63.	2. Also when he gives attention to it following the serial order, he should
do so not too quickly. For just as when a man sets out on a three-league journey
even if he has already done the journey out and back a hundred times rapidly
without taking note of [turnings] to be taken and avoided, though he may finish
his journey, he still has to ask how to get there, so too, when the meditator gives
his attention to the meditation subject too quickly though he may reach the end
of the meditation subject, it still does not become clear or bring about any
distinction. So he should not give his attention to it too quickly
64.	3. And as "not too quickly" so also not too slowly. For just as when a man
wants to do a three-league journey in one day, if he loiters on the way among
trees, rocks, pools, etc., he does not finish the journey in a day and needs two or
three to complete it, so too, if the meditator gives his attention to the meditation
subject too slowly, he does not get to the end and it does not become a condition
for distinction.
65.	4. As to warding off distraction: he must ward off [temptation] to drop the
meditation subject and to let his mind get distracted among the variety of external
objects. For if not, just as when a man has entered on a one-foot-wide cliff path,
if he looks about here and there without watching his step, he may miss his
footing and fall down the cliff, which is perhaps as high as a hundred men, so
too, when there is outward distraction, the meditation subject gets neglected
and deteriorates. So he should give his attention to it warding off distraction.
66.	5. As to surmounting the concept: this [name-] concept beginning with "head
hairs, body hairs" must be surmounted and consciousness established on [the
aspect] "repulsive." For just as when men find a water hole in a forest in a time
`241
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
of drought, they hang up some kind of signal there such as a palm leaf, and
people come to bathe and drink guided bv the signal, [245] but when the way
has become plain with their continual traffic, there is no further need of the
signal and they go to bathe and drink there whenever they want, so too, when
repulsiveness becomes evident to him as he is giving his attention to the
meditation subject through the means of the [name-] concept "head hairs, body
hairs," he must surmount the concept "head hairs, body hairs" and establish
consciousness on only the actual repulsiveness.
67. 6. As to successive leaving: in giving his attention he should eventually leave
out any [parts] that do not appear to him. For when a beginner gives his attention
to head hairs, his attention then carries on till it arrives at the last part, that is,
urine and stops there; and when he gives his attention to urine, his attention
then carries on till it arrives back at the first part, that is, head hairs, and stops
there. As he persists in giving his attention thus, some parts appear to him and
others do not. Then he should work on those that have appeared till one out of
any two appears the clearer. He should arouse absorption by again and again
giving attention to the one that has appeared thus.
68.	Here is a simile. Suppose a hunter wanted to catch a monkey that lived in a
grove of thirty-two palms, and he shot an arrow through a leaf of the palm that
stood at the beginning and gave a shout; then the monkey went leaping
successively from palm to palm till it reached the last palm; and when the
hunter went there too and did as before, it came back in like manner to the first
palm; and being followed thus again and again, after leaping from each place
where a shout was given, it eventually jumped on to one palm, and firmly seizing
the palm shoot's leaf spike in the middle, would not leap any more even when
shot—so it is with this.
69.	The application of the simile is this. The thirty-two parts of the body are like
the thirty-two palms in the grove. The monkey is like the mind. The meditator is
like the hunter. The range of the meditator's mind in the body with its thirty-two
parts as object is like the monkey's inhabiting the palm grove of thirty-two
palms. The settling down of the meditator's mind in the last part after going
successively [from part to part] when he began by giving his attention to head
hairs is like the monkey's leaping from palm to palm and going to the last palm,
[246] when the hunter shot an arrow through the leaf of the palm where it was
and gave a shout. Likewise in the return to the beginning. His doing the
preliminary work on those parts that have appeared, leaving behind those that
did not appear while, as he gave his attention to them again and again, some
appeared to him and some did not, is like the monkey's being followed and
leaping up from each place where a shout is given. The meditator's repeated
attention given to the part that in the end appears the more clearly of any two
that have appeared to him and his finally reaching absorption, is like the
monkey's eventually stopping in one palm, firmly seizing the palm shoot's leaf
spike in the middle and not leaping up even when shot.
70. There is another simile too. Suppose an alms-food-eater bhikkhu went to
live near a village of thirtv-two families, and when he got two lots of alms at the
first house he left out one [house] beyond it, and next day when he got three lots
`242
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
of [alms at the first house] he left out two [houses] beyond it, and on the third day
he got his bowl full at the first [house], and went to the sitting hall and ate—so it
is with this.
71. The thirty-two aspects are like the| village with the thirty-two families. The
meditator is like the alms-food eater. The meditator's preliminary work is like the
alms-food eater's going to live near the village. The meditator's continuing to
give attention after leaving out those parts that do not appear and doing his
preliminary work on the pair of parts that do appear is like the alms-food eater's
getting two lots of alms at the first house and leaving out one [house] beyond it,
and like his next day getting three [lots of alms at the first house] and leaving
out two [houses] beyond it. The arousing of absorption by giving attention
again and again to that which has appeared the more clearly of two is like the
alms-food eater's getting his bowl full at the first [house] on the third day and
then going to the sitting hall and eating.
72.	7. As to absorption: as to absorption part by part. The intention here is this:
it should be understood that absorption is brought about in each one of the
parts.
73.	8-10. As to the three suttantas: the intention here is this: it should be
understood that the three suttantas, namely those on higher consciousness,17 on
coolness, and on skill in the enlightenment factors, have as their purpose the
linking of energy with concentration.
74.	8. Herein, this sutta should be understood to deal with higher
consciousness: "Bhikkhus, there are three signs that should be given attention
from time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness. The sign of
concentration should be given attention from time to time, the sign of exertion
should be given attention from time to time, the sign of equanimity should be
given attention from time to time. [247] If a bhikkhu intent on higher
consciousness gives attention only to the sign of concentration, then his
consciousness may conduce to idleness. If a bhikkhu intent on higher
consciousness gives attention only to the sign of exertion, then his consciousness
may conduce to agitation. If a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness gives
attention only to the sign of equanimity, then his consciousness may not become
rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers. But, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu
intent on higher consciousness gives attention from time to time to the sign of
concentration ... to the sign of exertion ... to the sign of equanimity then his
consciousness becomes malleable, wieldy and bright, it is not brittle and becomes
rightly concentrated for the destruction of cankers.
75. "Bhikkhus, just as a skilled goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice prepares
his furnace and heats it up and puts crude gold into it with tongs; and he blows
on it from time to time, sprinkles water on it from time to time, and looks on at it
from time to time; and if the goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice only blew on
the crude gold, it would burn and if he only sprinkled water on it, it would cool
down, and if he only looked on at it, it would not get rightly refined; but, when
--

`243
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
the goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice blows on the crude gold from time to
time, sprinkles water on it from time to time, and looks on at it from time to time,
then it becomes malleable, wieldy and bright, it is not brittle, and it submits
rightly to being wrought; whatever kind of ornament he wants to work it into,
whether a chain or a ring or a necklace or a gold fillet, it serves his purpose.
76.	"So too, bhikkhus, there are three signs that should be given attention from
time to time by a bhikkhu intent on higher consciousness ... becomes rightly
concentrated for the destruction of cankers. [248] He attains the ability to be a
witness, through realization by direct-knowledge, of any state realizable by
direct-knowledge to which he inclines his mind, whenever there is occasion" (A
I 256-58).18
77.	9. This sutta deals with coolness: "Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses
six things, he is able to realize the supreme coolness. What six? Here, bhikkhus,
when consciousness should be restrained, he restrains it; when consciousness
should be exerted, he exerts it; when consciousness should be encouraged, he
encourages it; when consciousness should be looked on at with equanimity, he
looks on at it with equanimity. He is resolute on the superior [state to be attained],
he delights in Nibbana. Possessing these six things a bhikkhu is able to realize
the supreme coolness" (A III 435).
78.	10. Skill in the enlightenment factors has already been dealt with in the
explanation of skill in absorption (IV.51, 57) in the passage beginning,
"Bhikkhus, when the mind is slack, that is not the time for developing the
tranquillity enlightenment factor ..." (S V 113).
79.	So the meditator should make sure that he has apprehended this sevenfold
skill in learning well and has properly defined this tenfold skill in giving
attention, thus learning the meditation subject properly with both kinds of skill.
[Starting the Practice]
80.	If it is convenient for him to live in the same monastery as the teacher, then
he need not get it explained in detail thus [to begin with], but as he applies
himself to the meditation subject after he has made quite sure about it he can
have each successive stage explained as he reaches each distinction.
One who wants to live elsewhere, however, must get it explained to him in
detail in the way already given, and he must turn it over and over, getting all the
difficulties solved. He should leave an abode of an unsuitable kind as described
in the Description of the Earth Kasina, and go to live in a suitable one. Then he
should sever the minor impediments (IV20) and set about the preliminary work
for giving attention to repulsiveness.

[The Thirty-two Aspects in Detail]
81.	When he sets about it, he should first apprehend the [learning] sign in
head hairs. How? The colour should be defined first by plucking out one or two
head hairs and placing them on the palm of the hand. [249] He can also look at
them in the hair-cutting place, or in a bowl of water or rice gruel. If the ones he
sees are black when he sees them, they should be brought to mind as "black;" if
white, as "white;" if mixed, they should be brought to mind in accordance with
those most prevalent. And as in the case of head hairs, so too the sign should be
apprehended visually with the whole of the "skin pentad."
82.	Having apprehended the sign thus and (a) defined all the other parts of the
body by colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation (§58), he should then (b)
define repulsiveness in five ways, that is, by colour, shape, odour, habitat, and location.
83.	Here is the explanation of all the parts given in successive order.
[Head Hairs]
(a) Firstly head hairs are black in their normal colour, the colour of fresh
aritthaka seeds.19 As to shape, they are the shape of long round measuring rods.20
As to direction, they lie in the upper direction. As to location, their location is the
wet inner skin that envelops the skull; it is bounded on both sides bv the roots of
the ears, in front by the forehead, and behind by the nape of the neck.21 As to
delimitation, they are bounded below by the surface of their own roots, which are
fixed by entering to the amount of the tip of a rice grain into the inner skin that
envelops the head. They are bounded above by space, and all round by each
other. There are no two hairs together. This is their delimitation by the similar.
Head hairs are not body hairs, and body hairs are not head hairs; being likewise
not intermixed with the remaining thirty-one parts, the head hairs are a separate
part. This is their delimitation bv the dissimilar. Such is the definition of head
hairs as to colour and so on.
84. (b) Their definition as to repulsiveness in the five ways, that is, by colour, etc.,
is as follows. Head hairs are repulsive in colour as well as in shape, odour,
habitat, and location.
85.	For on seeing the colour of a head hair in a bowl of inviting rice gruel or
cooked rice, people are disgusted and say, "This has got hairs in it. Take it
away" So they are repulsive in colour. Also when people are eating at night, they
are likewise disgusted by the mere sensation of a hair-shaped akka-bark or makaci-
bark fibre. So they are repulsive in shape.
86.	And the odour of head hairs, unlejss dressed with a smearing of oil, scented
with flowers, etc., is most offensive. And it is still worse when they are put in the
--

20.	There are various readings.
21.	"Galavdtaka," here rendered by "nape of the neck," which the context demands.
But elsewhere (e.g. IV47, VIII. 110) "base of the neck" seems indicated, that is, where
the neck fits on to the body or "gullet."
`245

fire. [250] Even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in colour and shape, still
their odour is directly repulsive. Just as a baby's excrement, as to its colour, is the
colour of turmeric and, as to its shape, is the shape of a piece of turmeric root,
and just as the bloated carcass of a black dog thrown on a rubbish heap, as to its
colour, is the colour of a ripe palmyra fruit and, as to its shape, is the shape of a
[mandolin-shaped] drum left face down, and its fangs are like jasmine buds,
and so even if both these are not directljy repulsive in colour and shape, still their
odour is directly repulsive, so too, even if head hairs are not directly repulsive in
colour and shape, still their odour is directly repulsive.
87. But just as pot herbs that grow on village sewage in a filthy place are
disgusting to civilized people and unusable, so also head hairs are disgusting
since they grow on the sewage of pus, blood, urine, dung, bile, phlegm, and the
like. This is the repulsive aspect of the habitat.
88. And these head hairs grow on the heap of the [other] thirty-one parts as
fungi do on a dung-hill. And owing to the filthy place they grow in they are
quite as unappetizing as vegetables growing on a charnel-ground, on a midden,
etc., as lotuses or water lilies growing in drains, and so on. This is the repulsive
aspect of their location.
89.	And as in the case of head hairs, so also the repulsiveness of all the parts
should be defined (b) in the same five ways by colour, shape, odour, habitat, and
location. All, however, must be defined individually (a) by colour, shape, direction,
location, and delimitation, as follows.
[Body Hairs]
90.	Herein, firstly, as to natural colour, body hairs are not pure black like head
hairs but blackish brown. As to shape, they are the shape of palm roots with the
tips bent down. As to direction, they lie in the two directions. As to location,
except for the locations where the head hairs are established, and for the palms
of the hands and soles of the feet, they grow in most of the rest of the inner skin
that envelops the body. As to delimitation, they are bounded below by the surface
i	—y--—--j-
of their own roots, which are fixed by entering to the extent of a likhd22 into the
inner skin that envelops the body, above by space, and all round by each other. There
are no two body hairs together. This is the delimitation by the similar. But their
delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs. [Note: These two last
sentences are repeated verbatim at the end of the description of each part. Thev
are not translated in the remaining thirty parts].
[Nails]
91. "Nails" is the name for the twenty nail plates. They are all white as to
colour. As to shape, they are the shape of fish scales. As to direction: the toenails
are in the lower direction; the fingernails are in the upper direction. [251] So
they grow in the two directions. As |to location, they are fixed on the tips of the
backs of the fingers and toes. As to delimitation, they are bounded in the two
22. A measure of length, as much as a "louse's head."
`246
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
directions by the flesh of the ends of the fingers and toes, and inside by the flesh
of the backs of the fingers and toes, and externally and at the end by space, and
all round by each other. There are no two nails together ...
[Teeth]
92. There are thirty-two tooth bones in one whose teeth are complete. They are
white in colour. As to shape, they are of various shapes; for firstly in the lower row,
the four middle teeth are the shape of pumpkin seeds set in a row in a lump of
clay; that on each side of them has one root and one point and is the shape of a
jasmine bud; each one after that has two roots and two points and is the shape of
a wagon prop; then two each side with three roots and three points, then two
each side four-rooted and four-pointed. Likewise in the upper row. As to direction,
they lie in the upper direction. As to location, they are fixed in the jawbones. As
to delimitation, they are bounded by the surface or their own roots which are
fixed in the jawbones; they are bounded above by space, and all round by each
other. There are no two teeth together ...
[Skin (Taca)]
93.	The inner skin envelops the whole body. Outside it is what is called the
outer cuticle, which is black, brown or yellow in colour, and when that from the
whole of the body is compressed together, it amounts to onlv as much as a
jujube-fruit kernel. But as to colour, the skin itself is white; and its whiteness
becomes evident when the outer cuticle is destroyed by contact with the flame of
a fire or the impact of a blow and so on.
94.	As to shape, it is the shape of the body in brief. But in detail, the skin of the
toes is the shape of silkworms' cocoons; the skin of the back of the foot is the
shape of shoes with uppers; the skin of the calf is the shape of a palm leaf
wrapping cooked rice; the skin of the thighs is the shape of a long sack full of
paddy; the skin of the buttocks is the shape of a cloth strainer full of water; the
skin of the back is the shape of hide streched over a plank; the skin of the belly is
the shape of the hide stretched over the body of a lute; the skin of the chest is more or
less square; the skin of both arms is the shape of the hide stretched over a quiver; the
skin of the backs of the hands is the shape of a razor box, or the shape of a comb case;
the skin of the fingers is the shape of a key box; the skin of the neck is the shape of a
collar for the throat; the skin of the face [252] is the shape of an insects' nest full of
holes; the skin of the head is the shape of a bowl bag.
95. The meditator who is discerning the skin should first define the inner skin
that covers the face, working his knowledge over the face beginning with the
upper lip. Next, the inner skin of the frontal bone. Next, he should define the
inner skin of the head, separating, as it were, the inner skin's connection with
the bone by inserting his knowledge in between the cranium bone and the inner
skin of the head, as he might his hand in between the bag and the bowl put in
the bag. Next, the inner skin of the shoulders. Next, the inner skin of the right
arm forwards and backwards; and then in the same way the inner skin of the left
`247
Chapter VIII

arm. Next, after defining the inner skin of the back, he should define the inner
skin of the right leg forwards and backwards; then the inner skin of the left leg
in the same way. Next, the inner skin of the groin, the paunch, the bosom and the
neck should be successively defined. Then, after defining the inner skin of the
lower jaw next after that of the neck, he should finish on arriving at the lower lip.
When he discerns it in the gross in this way, it becomes evident to him more
subtly too.
96.	As to direction, it lies in both directions. As to location, it covers the whole bodv.
As to delimitation, it is bounded below by its fixed surface, and above by space ...
[Flesh]
97.	There are nine hundred pieces of flesh. As to colour, it is all red, like kimsuka
flowers. As to shave, the flesh of the calves is the shape of cooked rice in a palm-
leaf bag. The flesh of the thighs is the shape of a rolling pin.23 The flesh of the
buttocks is the shape of the end of an oven. The flesh of the back is the shape of
a slab of palm sugar. The flesh between each two ribs is the shape of clay mortar
squeezed thin in a flattened opening. The flesh of the breast is the shape of a
lump of clav made into a ball and flung down. The flesh of the two upper arms
is the shape of a large skinned rat and twice the size. When he discerns it
grossly in this way it becomes evident to him subtly too.
98.	As to direction, it lies in both directions. As to location, it is plastered over the
three hundred and odd bones. [25(3] As to delimitation, it is bounded below by its
surface, which is fixed on to the collection of bones, and above by the skin, and
all round each by each other piece ...
[Sinews]
99.	There are nine hundred sinews. As to colour, all the sinews are white. As to
shape, they have various shapes. For five of great sinews that bind the body together
start out from the upper part of the neck and descend by the front, and five more
by the back, and then five by the right and five by the left. And of those that bind
the right hand, five descend by the front of the hand and five by the back; likewise
those that bind the left hand. And of those that bind the right foot, five descend
by the front and five by the back; likewise those that bind the left foot. So there are
sixtv great sinews called "body supporters" which descend [from the neck] and
bind the body together; and they are also called "tendons." They are all the
shape of yam shoots. But there are others scattered over various parts of the body
which are finer than the last-named. They are the shape of strings and cords.
There are others still finer, the shape of creepers. Others still finer are the shape
of large lute strings. Yet others are the shape of coarse thread. The sinews in the
backs of the hands and feet are the shape of a bird's claw. The sinews in the head
are the shape of children's head nets. The sinews in the back are the shape of a
23. Nisadapota—"rolling pin": (= sild-pnttaka—Vism-mht 250) What is meant is probably
the stone roller, thicker in the middle than at the ends, with which curry spices, etc., are
normally rolled by hand on a small stone slab in Sri Lanka today.
`248

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
wet net spread out in the sun. The rest of the sinews, following the various limbs,
are the shape of a net jacket fitted to the body.
100.	As to direction, they lie in the two directions. As to location, they are to be
found binding the bones of the whole body together. As to delimitation, they are
bounded below by their surface, which is fixed on to the three hundred bones,
and above by the portions that are in contact with the flesh and the inner skin,
and all round by each other ...
[Bones]
101.	Excepting the thirty-two teeth bones, these consist of the remaining sixty-
four hand bones, sixty-four foot bones, sixty-four soft bones dependent on the
flesh, two heel bones; then in each leg two ankle bones, two shin bones, one knee
bone and one thigh bone; then two hip bones, eighteen spine bones, [254] twenty-
four rib bones, fourteen breast bones, one heart bone (sternum), two collar bones, two
shoulder blade bones,24 two upper-arm bones, two pairs of forearm bones, two neck
bones, two jaw bones, one nose bone, two eye bones, two ear bones, one frontal bone,
one occipital bone, nine sincipital bones. So there are exactly three hundred bones.
As to colour, thev are all white. As to shape, they are of various shapes.
102.	Herein, the end bones of the toes are the shape of kataka seeds. Those next
to them in the middle sections are the shape of jackfruit seeds. The bones of the
base sections are the shape of small drums. The bones of the back of the foot are
the shape of a bunch of bruised yarns. The heel bone is the shape of the seed of
a single-stone palmyra fruit.
103.	The ankle bones are the shape of [two] play balls bound together. The
shin bones, in the place where they rest on the ankle bones, are the shape of a
sindi shoot without the skin removed. The small shin bone is the shape of a[tov]
bow stick. The large one is the shape of a shrivelled snake's back. The knee bone
is the shape of a lump of froth melted on one side. Herein, the place where the
shin bone rests on it is the shape of a blunt cow's horn. The thigh bone is the
shape of a badly-pared25 handle for an axe or hatchet. The place where it fits into
the hip bone is the shape of a play ball. The place in the hip bone where it is set
is the shape of a big punndga fruit with the end cut off.
104. The two hip bones, when fastened together, are the shape of the ring-
fastening of a smith's hammer. The buttock bone on the end [of them] is the
shape of an inverted snake's hood. It is perforated in seven or eight places. The
spine bones are internally the shape of lead-sheet pipes put one on top of the
other; externally they are the shape of a string of beads. They have two or three
rows of projections next to each other like the teeth of a saw.
--
24.	Kotthatthlni—"shoulder-blade bones": for kottlia (= flat) cf. kotthalika §97; the
meaning is demanded by the context, otherwise no mention would be made of these
two bones, and the description fits. PED under this ref. has "stomach bone" (?).
Should one read a-tikhina (blunt) or ati-khina (very sharp)?
25.	Duttacchita—"badly pared": tacchita, pp. of taccliati to pare (e.g. with an adze); not
in PED; see M I 31,124; III 166.

105.	Of the twenty-four rib bones, the incomplete ones are the shape of incomplete
sabres, [255] and the complete ones are the shape of complete sabres; all together
they are like the outspread wings of a white cock. The fourteen breast bones are the
shape of an old chariot frame.26 The heart bone (sternum) is the shape of the bowl of
a spoon. The collar bones are the shape of small metal knife handles. The shoulder-
blade bones are the shape of a Sinhalese hoe worn down on one side.
106.	The upper-arm bones are the shape of looking glass handles. The forearm
bones are the shape of a twin palm's trunks. The wrist bones are the shape of
lead-sheet pipes stuck together. The bones of the back of the hand are the shape
of a bundle of bruised yams. As to the fingers, the bones of the base sections are
the shape of small drums; those of the middle sections are the shape of immature
jackfruit seeds; those of the end sections are the shape of kataka seeds.
107.	The seven neck bones are the shape of rings of bamboo stem threaded one
after the other on a stick. The lower jawbone is the shape of a smith's iron
hammer ring-fastening. The upper one is the shape of a knife for scraping [the
rind off sugarcanes]. The bones of the eye sockets and nostril sockets are the
shape of young palmyra seeds with the kernels removed. The frontal bone is the
shape of an inverted bowl made of a shell. The bones of the ear-holes are the
shape of barbers' razor boxes. The bone in the place where a cloth is tied [round
the head] above the frontal bone and the ear holes is the shape of a piece of
curled-up toffee flake.27 The occipital bone is the shape of a lopsided coconut
with a hole cut in the end. The sincipital bones are the shape of a dish made of
an old gourd held together with stitches.
108. As to direction, they lie in both directions. As to location, thev are to be found
indiscriminately throughout the whole body But in particular here, the head bones
rest on the neck bones, the neck bones on the spine bones, the spine bones on the hip
bones, the hip bones on the thigh bones, the thigh bones on the knee bones, the knee
bones on the shin bones, the shin bones on the ankle bones, the ankle bones on the
bones of the back of the foot. As to delimitation, they are bounded inside by the bone
marrowy above by the flesh, at the ends and at the roots by each other ...
[Bone Marrow]
109. This is the marrow inside the various bones. As to colour, it is white. As to
shape, [256] that inside each large bone is the shape of a large cane shoot moistened
and inserted into a bamboo tube. That inside each small bone is the shape of a
slender cane shoot moistened and inserted in a section of bamboo twig. As to
direction, it lies in both directions. As to location, it is set inside the bones. As to
delimitation, it is delimited by the inner surface of the bones ...

[Kidney]
110.	This is two pieces of flesh with a single ligature. As to colour, it is dull red,
the colour of palibhaddaka (coral tree) seeds. As to shape, it is the shape of a pair
of child's play balls; or it is the shape of a pair of mango fruits attached to a
single stalk. As to direction, it lies in the upper direction. As to location, it is to be
found on either side of the heart flesh, being fastened by a stout sinew that starts out
with one root from the base of the neck and divides into two after going a short way
As to delimitation, the kidney is bounded by what appertains to kidney ...
[Heart]
111.	This is the heart flesh. As to colour, it is the colour of the back of a red-lotus
petal. As to shape, it is the shape of a lotus bud with the outer petals removed and
turned upside down; it is smooth outside, and inside it is like the interior of a
kosdtakl (loofah gourd). In those who possess understanding it is a little
expanded; in those without understanding it is still only a bud. Inside it there is
a hollow the size of a punndga seed's bed where half a pasata measure of blood is
kept, with which as their support the mind element and mind-consciousness
element occur.
112.	That in one of greedy temperament is red; that in one of hating
temperament is black; that in one of deluded temperament is like water that meat
has been washed in; that in one of speculative temperament is like lentil soup in
colour; that in one of faithful temperament is the colour of [yellow] kanikdra
flowers; that in one of understanding temperament is limpid, clear, unturbid,
bright, pure, like a washed gem of pure water, a|nd it seems to shine.
113.	As to direction, it lies in the upper direction. As to location, it is to be found
in the middle between the two breasts, inside the body. As to delimitation, it is
bounded by what appertains to heart ... [257]
[Liver]
114.	This is a twin slab of flesh. As to colour, it is a brownish shade of red, the
colour of the not-too-red backs of white water-lily petals. As to shape, with its
single root and twin ends, it is the shape of a kovildra leaf. In sluggish people it
is single and large; in those possessed of understanding there are two or three
small ones. As to direction, it lies in the upper direction. As to location, it is to be
found on the right side, inside from the two breasts. As to delimitation, it is
bounded by what appertains to liver ...
[Midriff]28
115. This is the covering of the| flesh, which is of two kinds, namely the concealed
and the unconcealed. As to colour, both kinds are white, the colour of duktila
(muslin) rags. As to shape, it is the shape of its location. As to direction, the

concealed midriff lies in the upper direction, the other in both directions. As to
location, the concealed midriff is to be found concealing the heart and kidney;
the unconcealed is to be found covering the flesh under the inner skin throughout
the whole body. As to delimitation, it is bounded below by the flesh, above by the
inner skin, and all round by what appertains to midriff ...
[Spleen]
116. This is the flesh of the belly's "tongue." As to colour, it is blue, the colour of
niggundi flowers. As to shape, it is seven fingers in size, without attachments, and
the shape of a black calf's tongue. As to direction, it lies in the upper direction. As
to location, it is to be found near the upper side of the belly to the left of the heart.
When it comes out through a wound a being's life is terminated. As to delimitation,
it is bounded by what appertains to spleen ...
[Lungs]
117.	The flesh of the lungs is divided up into two or three pieces of flesh. As to
colour, it is red, the colour of not very ripe udumbara fig fruits. As to shape, it is the
shape of an unevenly cut thick slice of cake. Inside, it is insipid and lacks nutritive
essence, like a lump of chewed straw, because it is affected by the heat of the
kamma-born fire [element] that springs up when there is need of something to
eat and drink. As to direction, it lies in the upper direction. As to location, it is to
be found inside the body between the two breasts, hanging above the heart [258]
and liver and concealing them. A|s to delimitation, it is bounded by what
appertains to lungs ...
[Bowel]
118.	This is the bowel tube; it is looped29 in twenty-one places, and in a man it
is thirty-two hands long, and in a woman, twenty-eight hands. As to colour, it is
white, the colour of lime [mixed] with sand. As to shape, it is the shape of a
beheaded snake coiled up and put in a trough of blood. As to direction, it lies in
the two directions. As to location, it is fastened above at the gullet and below to
the excrement passage (rectum), so it is to be found inside the body between the
limits of the gullet and the excrement passage. As to delimitation, it is bounded
by what pertains to bowel ...
[Entrails (Mesentery)]
119. This is the fastening in the places where the bowel is coiled. As to colour,
it is white, the colour of dakasitalika30 (white edible water lily) roots. As to shape, it is
the shape of those roots too. As to direction, it lies in the two directions. As to
location, it is to be found inside the twenty-one coils of the bowel, like the strings

to be found inside rope-rings for wiping the feet on, sewing them together, and
it fastens the bowel's coils together so that they do not slip down in those working
with hoes, axes, etc., as the marionette-strings do the marionette's wooden [limbs]
at the time of the marionette's being pulled along. As to delimitation, it is bounded
by what appertains to entrails ...
[Gorge]
120.	This is what has been eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted, and is present in the
stomach. As to colour, it is the colour of swallowed food. As to shape, it is the shape of
rice loosely tied in a cloth strainer. As to direction, it is in the upper direction. As to
location, it is in the stomach.
121.	What is called the "stomach" is [a part of] the bowel-membrane, which is
like the swelling [of air] produced in the middle of a length of wet cloth when it
is being [twisted and] wrung out from the two ends. It is smooth outside. Inside,
it is like a balloon of cloth31 soiled by wrapping up meat refuse; or it can be said
to be like the inside of the skin of a rotten jack fruit. It is the place where worms
dwell seething in tangles: the thirty-two families of worms, such as round worms,
boil-producing worms, "palm-splinter" worms, needle-mouthed worms, tape-
worms, thread worms, and the rest.32 When there is no food and drink, [259] etc.,
present, they leap up shrieking and pounce upon the heart's flesh; and when
food and drink, etc| are swallowed, they wait with uplifted mouths and scramble
to snatch the first two or three lumps swallowed. It is these worms' maternity
home, privy hospital and charnel ground. Just as when it has rained heavily in
a time of drought and what has been carried by the water into the cesspit at the
gate of an outcaste village—the various kinds of ordure33 such as urine, excrement,
bits of hide and bones and sinews, as well as spittle, snot, blood, etc.—gets
mixed up with the mud and water already collected there; and after two or three
days the families of worms appear, and it ferments, warmed by the energy of the
sun's heat, frothing and bubbling on the top, quite black in colour, and so utterly
stinking and loathsome that one can scarcely go near it or look at it, much less
smell or taste it, so too, [the stomach is where] the assortment of food, drink, etc.,
falls after being pounded up by the tongue and stuck together with spittle and

31.	Mamsaka-sainbiipali-vethana-kilittlia-pavara-pupphaka-sadisa: this is rendered into
Sinhalese by kunu inns knsnln vein porond kndek pup ("an inflated piece (or bag) of cloth,
which has wrapped rotten meat refuse"). In PED pdvdra is given as "cloak, mantle"
and (this ref.) as "the mango tree"; but there seems to be no authority for the rendering
"mango tree," which has nothing to do with this context. Pupphaka (balloon) is not in
PED (cf. common Burmese spelling of bubbula (bubble) as pupphiila).
32.	It would be a mistake to take the renderings of these worms' names too literally.
Ganduppada (boil-producing worm?) appears only as "earth worm" in PED, which will
not do here. The more generally accepted reading seems to take patatantuka and
suttaka (tape-worm and thread worm) as two kinds rather than patatantusuttnka; neither
is in PED.

meaning either here or, e.g., at XI.21, where the sense of a dead body is inappropriate.

saliva, losing at that moment its virtues of colour, smell, taste, etc., and taking on
the appearance of weavers' paste and dogs' vomit, then to get soused in the bile
and phlegm and wind that have collected there, where it ferments with the
energy of the stomach-fire's heat, seethes with the families of worms, frothing
and bubbling on the top, till it turns into utterly stinking nauseating muck, even
to hear about which takes aw|ay any appetite for food, drink, etc., let alone to see
it with the eye of understanding. And when the food, drink, etc., fall into it, they
get divided into five parts: the worms eat one part, the stomach-fire bums up
another part, another part becomes urine, another part becomes excrement, and
one part is turned into nourishment and sustains the blood, flesh and so on.
122. As to delimitation, it is bounded by the stomach lining and by what
appertains to gorge ...
[Dung]
123.	This is excrement. As to colour, it is mostly the colour of eaten food. As to
shape, it is the shape of its location. As to direction, it is in the lower direction. As
to location, it is to be found in the receptacle for digested food (rectum).
124.	The receptacle for digested food is the lowest part at the end of the bowel,
between the navel and the root of the spine. [260] It measures eight fingerbreadths
in height and resembles a bamboo tube. Just as when rain water falls on a higher
level it runs down to fill a lower level and stays there, so too, the receptacle for
digested food is where an|y food, drink, etc., that have fallen into the receptacle
for undigested food, have been continuously cooked and simmered by the
stomach-fire, and have got as soft as though ground up on a stone, run down to
through the cavities of the bowels, and it is pressed down there till it becomes
impacted like brown clay pushed into a bamboo joint, and there it stays.
125.	As to delimitation, it is bounded by the receptacle for digested food and by
what appertains to dung ...
[Brain]
126.	This is the lumps of marrow to be found inside the skull. As to colour, it is
white, the colour of the flesh of a toadstool; it can also be said that it is the colour
of turned milk that has not yet become curd. As to shape, it is the shape of its
location. As to direction, it belongs to the upper direction. As to location, it is to be
found inside the skull, like four lumps of dough put together to correspond
with the [skull's] four sutured sections. As to delimitation, it is bounded by the
skull's inner surface and by what appertains to brain ...
[Bile]
127.	There are two kinds of bile: local bile and free bile. Herein as to colour, the
local bile is the colour of thick madhuka oil; the free bile is the colour of faded
dkull flowers. As to shape, both are the shape of their location. As to direction, the
local bile belongs to the upper direction; the other belongs to both directions. As
to location, the free bile spreads, like a drop of oil on water, all over the body
`254
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs, body hairs, teeth, nails, and the
hard dry skin. When it is disturbed, the eyes become yellow and twitch, and
there is shivering and itching34 of the body. The local bile is situated near the
flesh of the liver between the heart and the lungs. It is to be found in the bile
container (gall bladder), which is like a large kosdtakl (loofah) gourd pip. When
it is disturbed, beings go crazv and become demented, they throw off conscience
and shame and do the undoable, speak the unspeakable, and think the
unthinkable. As to delimitation, it is bounded by what appertains to bile ... [261]
[Phlegm]
128. The phlegm is inside the body and it measures a bowlful. As to colour, it is
white, the colour of the juice of ndgabald leaves. As to shape, it is the shape of its
location. As to direction, it belongs to the upper direction. As to location, it is to be
found on the stomach's surface. Just as duckweed and green scum on the surface
-----~ — -----— - — —----T— — -------------- ——	-------
of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then
spread together again, so too, at the time of eating and drinking, etc., when the
food, drink, etc., fall into the stomach, the phlegm divides and then spreads
together again. And if it gets weak the stomach becomes utterly disgusting with
a smell of ordure, like a ripe boil or a rotten hen's egg, and then the belchings
and the mouth reek with a stench like rotting ordure rising from the stomach, so
that the man has to be told, "Go away your breath smells." But when it grows
plentiful it holds the stench of ordure beneath the surface of the stomach, acting like
the wooden lid of a privy As to delimitation, it is bounded by what appertains to
phlegm ...
129. Pus is produced by decaying blood. As to colour, it is the colour of bleached
leaves; but in a dead body it is the colour of stale thickened gruel. As to shape, it
is the shape of its location. As to direction, it belongs to both directions. As to
location, however, there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found
stored up. Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the body
of water divide when a stick or a potsherd is dropped into the water and then
spread together again, so too, at the time of eating and drinking, etc., when the
food, drink, etc., fall into the stomach, the phlegm divides and then spreads

a smell of ordure, like a ripe boil or a rotten hen's egg, and then the belchings

129. Pus is produced by decaying blood. As to colour, it is the colour of bleached
leaves; but in a dead body it is the colour of stale thickened gruel. As to shape, it
is the shape of its location. As to direction, it belongs to both directions. As to
location, however, there is no fixed location for pus where it could be found
stored up. Wherever blood stagnates and goes bad in some part of the body
damaged by wounds with stumps and thorns, by burns with fire, etc., or where
boils, carbuncles, etc., appear, it can be found there. As to delimitation, it is bounded
by what appertains to pus ...
[Blood]
130. There are two kinds of blood: stored blood and mobile blood. Herein, as to
colour, stored blood is the colour of cooked and thickened lac solution; mobile blood
is the colour of clear lac solution. As to shape, both are the shape of their locations. As
to direction, the stored blood belongs to the upper direction; the other belongs to both
directions. As to location, except for the fleshless parts of the head hairs, body hairs,
teeth, nails, and the hard dry skin, the mobile blood permeates the whole of the
climg-to (kammically-acquired)35 body by following the network of veins. The
--

`255
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
stored blood fills the lower part of the liver's site [262] to the extent of a
bowlful, and by its splashing little by little over the heart, kidney and lungs,
it keeps the kidney, heart, liver and lungs moist. For it is when it fails to
moisten the kidney, heart, etc., that beings become thirsty. As to delimitation,
it is bounded by what appertains to blood ...
[Sweat]
131. This is the water elemjent that trickles from the pores of the body hairs, and
so on. As to colour, it is the colour of clear sesame oil. As to shape, it is the shape
of its location. As to direction, it belongs to both directions. As to location, there is
no fixed location for sweat where it could always be found like blood. But if the
body is heated by the heat of a fire, by the sun's heat, by a change of temperature,
etc., then it trickles from all the pore openings of the head hairs and body hairs,
as water does from a bunch of unevenly cut lily-bud stems and lotus stalks
pulled up from the water. So its shape should also be understood to correspond
to the pore-openings of the head hairs and body hairs. And the meditator who
discerns sweat should only give his attention to it as it is to be found filling the
pore-openings of the head hairs and body hairs. As to delimitation, it is bounded
by what appertains to sweat ...
[Fat]
132. This is a thick unguent. As to colour, it is the colour of sliced turmeric. As
to shape, firstly in the body of a stout man it is the shape of turmeric-coloured
dnkula (muslin) rags placed between the inner skin and the flesh. In the body of
a| lean man it is the shape of turmeric-coloured dukula (muslin) rags placed in
two or three thicknesses on the shank flesh, thigh flesh, back flesh near the
spine, and belly-covering flesh. As to direction, it belongs to both directions. As
to location, it permeates the whole of a stout man's body; it is to be found on a
lean man's shank flesh, and so on. And though it was described as "unguent"
above, still it is neither used as oil on the head nor as oil for the nose, etc., because
of its utter disgustingness. As to delimitation, it is bounded below by the flesh,
above by the inner skin, and all round by what appertains to fat ...
[Tears]
133. These are the water element that trickles from the eye. As to colour, they are
the colour of clear sesame oil. As to shape, they are the shape of their location.
[263] As to direction, they belong to the upper direction. As to location, they are to
be found in the eye sockets. But they are not stored in the eye sockets all the while
as the bile is in the bile container. But when beings feel joy and laugh uproariously
or feel grief and weep and lament, or eat particular kinds of wrong food, or
when their eyes are affected [by smoke, dust, dirt, etc., then being originated by
the joy, grief, wrong food, or temperature, thev fill up the eye sockets or trickle
out. And the meditator who discerns tears should discern them only as thev are
35. Upadinna—"clung-to": see Ch. XIV note 23.
`256

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
to be found filling the eye sockets. As to delimitation, they are bounded by what
appertains to tears ...
[Grease]
134. This is a melted unguent. As to colour, it is the colour of coconut oil. Also
it can be said to be the colour of oil sprinkled on gruel. As to shape, it is a film the
shape of a drop of unguent spread out over still water at the time of bathing. As
to direction, it belongs to both directions. As to location, it is to be found mostly on
the palms of the hands, backs of the hands, soles of the feet, backs of the feet, tip
of the nose, forehead, and points of the shoulders. And it is not always to be
found in the melted state in these locations, but when these parts get hot with the
heat of a fire, the sun's heat, upset of temperature or upset of elements, then it
spreads here and there in those places like the film from the drop of unguent on
the still water at the time of bathing. As to delimitation, it is bounded by what
appertains to grease ...
[Spittle]
135. This is water element mixed with froth inside the mouth. As to colour, it is
white, the colour of the froth. As to shape, it is the shape of its location, or it can be
called "the shape of froth." As to direction, it belongs to the upper direction. As
to location, it is to be found on the tongue after it has descended from the cheeks
on both sides. And it is not always to be found stored there; but when beings see
particular kinds of food, or remember them, or put something hot or bitter or
sharp or salty or sour into their mouths, or when their hearts are faint, or nausea
arises on some account, then spittle appears and runs down from the cheeks on
both sides to settle on the tongue. It is thin at the tip of the tongue, and thick at
the root of the tongue. It is capable, without getting used up, of wetting unhusked
rice or husked rice or anything else chewable that is put into the mouth, like the
water in a pit scooped out in a river sand bank. [264] As to delimitation, it is
bounded by what appertains to spittle ...
[Snot]
136. This is impurity that trickles out from the brain. As to colour, it is the
colour of a young palmyra kernel. As to shape, it is the shape of its location. As to
direction, it belongs to the upper direction. As to location, it is to be found filling
the nostril cavities. And it is not always to be found stored there; but rather, just
as though a man tied up curd in a lotus leaf, which he then pricked with a thorn
underneath, and whey oozed out and dripped, so too, when beings weep or
suffer a disturbance of elements produced by wrong food or temperature, then
the brain inside the head turns into stale phlegm, and it oozes out and comes
down by an opening in the palate, and it fills the nostrils and stays there or
trickles out. And the meditator who discerns snot should discern it onlv as it is
to be found filling the nostril cavities. As to delimitation, it is bounded by what
appertains to snot ...
`257

[Oil of the Joints]
137. This is the slimy ordure inside the joints in the body As to colour, it is the
colour of kanikara gum. As to shape, it is the shape of its location. As to direction,
it belongs to both directions. As to location, it is to be found inside the hundred
and eighty joints, serving the function of lubricating the bones' joints. If it is
weak, when a man gets up oij sits down, moves forward or backward, bends or
stretches, then his bones creak, and he goes about making a noise like the
snapping of fingers, and when he has walked only one or two leagues' distance,
his air element gets upset and his limbs pain him. But if a man has plenty of it, his
bones do not creak when he gets up, sits down, etc., and even when he has walked
a long distance, his air element does not get upset and his limbs do not pain him. As
to delimitation, it is bounded by what appertains to oil of the joints ...
[Urine]
138.	This is the urine solution. As to colour, it is the colour of bean brine. As to
shape, it is the shape of water inside a water pot placed upside down. As to
direction, it belongs to the lower direction. As to location, it is to be found inside
the bladder. For the bladder sack is called the bladder. Just as when a porous pot
with no mouth is put into a cesspool, [265] then the solution from the cesspool
gets into the porous pot with no mouth even though no way of entry is evident,
so too, while the urinary secretion from the body enters the bladder its way of
entry is not evident. Its way of exit, however, is evident. And when the bladder is
full of urine, beings feel the need to make water. As to delimitation, it is delimited
by the inside of the bladder and by what is similar to urine. This is the delimitation
by the similar. But its delimitation by the dissimilar is like that for the head hairs
(see note at end of §90).
[The Arising of Absorption]
139.	When the meditator has defined the parts beginning with the head hairs
in this way by colour, shape, direction, location and delimitation (§58), and he
gives his attention in the ways beginning with "following the order, not too
quickly" (§61) to their repulsiveness in the five aspects of colour, shape, smell,
habitat, and location (§84f.), then at last he surmounts the concept (§66). Then
just as when a man with good sight is observing a garland of flowers of thirty-
two colours knotted on a single string and all the flowers become evident to him
simultaneously so too, when the meditator observes this body thus, "There are in
this body head hairs," then all these things become evident to him, as it were,
simultaneously. Hence it was said above in the explanation of skill in giving
attention: "For when a beginner gives his attention to head hairs, his attention
carries on till it a|rrives at the last part, that is, urine, and stops there" (§67).
140. If he applies his attention externally as well when all the parts have become
evident in this wav, then human beings, animals, etc., as they go about are
divested of their aspect of beings and appear as just assemblages of parts. And
`258
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
when drink, food, etc., is being swallowed by them, it appears as though it were
being put in among the assemblage of parts.
141.	Then, as he gives his attention to them again and again as "Repulsive,
repulsive," employing the process of "successive leaving," etc. (§67), eventually
absorption arises in him. Herein, the appearance of the head hairs, etc., as to
colour, shape, direction, location, and delimitation is the learning sign; their
appearance as repulsive in all aspects is the counterpart sign.
As he cultivates and develops that counterpart sign, absorption arises in him,
but only of the first jhana, in the same way as described under foulness as a
meditation subject (VI.64f.). And it arises singly in one to whom onlv one part
has become evident, or who has reached absorption in one part and makes no
further effort about another.
142.	But several first jhanas, according to the number of parts, are produced in
one to whom several parts have become evident, or who has reached jhana in
one and also makes further effort about another. As in the case of the Elder
Mallaka. [266]
The elder, it seems, took the Elder Abhaya, the Digha reciter, by the hand,36
and after saving "Friend Abhaya, first learn this matter," he went on: "The Elder
Mallaka is an obtainer of thirty-two jhanas in the thirty-two parts. If he enters
upon one by night and one by day he goes on entering upon them for over a
fortnight; but if he enters upon one each day he goes on entering upon them for
over a month."
143.	And although this m|editation is successful in this way with the first
jhana, it is nevertheless called "mindfulness occupied with the body" because it
is successful through the influence of the mindfulness ot the colour, shape, and
so on.
144.	And the bhikkhu who is devoted to this mindfulness occupied with the
body "is a conqueror of boredom and delight, and boredom does not conquer
him; he dwells transcending boredom as it arises. He is a conqueror of fear and
dread, and fear and dread do not conquer him; he dwells transcending fear and
dread as they arise. He is one who bears cold and heat ... who endures ... arisen
bodily feelings that are ... menacing to life" (M III 97); he becomes an obtainer of
the four jhanas based on the colour aspect of the head hairs,37 etc.; and he comes
to penetrate the six kinds of direct-knowledge (see MN 6).
So let a man, if he is wise,
Untiringly devote his days
To mindfulness of body which
Rewards him in so many ways.
36.	Reference is sometimes made to the "hand-grasping question" (hattha-gahaka
panha). It may be to this; but there is another mentioned at the end of the commentary
to the Dhatu-Vibhanga.
37.	The allusion seems to be to the bases of mastery (abhibhdyatana—or better,
bases for transcendence); see M II13 and M-a III 257f.; but see §60.
`259
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
This is the section dealing with mindfulness occupied with the body in the
detailed treatise.
[(9) Mindfulness of Breathing]
145. Now comes the description of the development of mindfulness of breathing
as a meditation subject. It has been recommended by the Blessed One thus:
"And, bhikkhus, this concentration through mindfulness of breathing, when
developed and practiced much, is both peaceful and sublime, it is an
unadulterated blissful abiding, and it banishes at once and stills evil unprofitable
thoughts as soon as they arise" (S V 321; Vin III 70).
[Text]
It has been described by the Blessed One as having sixteen bases thus: "And
how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much, is concentration through
mindfulness of breathing both peaceful and sublime, an unadulterated blissful
abiding, banishing at once and stilling evil unprofitable thoughts as soon as
they arise?
"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an
empty place, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect,
established mindfulness in front of him, [267] ever mindful he breathes in,
mindful he breathes out.
"(i) Breathing in long, he knows: T breathe in long;' or breathing out long, he
knows: 'I breathe out long.' (ii) Breathing in short, he knows: 'I breathe in short;'
or breathing out short|, he knows: 'I breathe out short.' (iii) He trains thus: 'I shall
breathe in experiencing the whole body;' he trains thus: T shall breathe out
experiencing the whole body' (iv) He trains thus: T shall breathe in tranquilizing
the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily
formation.'
"(v) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in experiencing happiness;' he trains
thus: T shall breathe out experiencing happiness.' (vi) He trains thus: 'I shall
i	o r i-* '-
breathe in experiencing bliss;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out experiencing
bliss.' (vii) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in experiencing the mental formation;'
he trains thus: T shall breathe out experiencing the mental formation.' (viii) He
trains thus: T shall breathe in tranquilizing the mental formation;' he trains
thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the mental formation.'
"(ix) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in experiencing the [manner of]
consciousness;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out experiencing the [manner of]
consciousness.' (x) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in gladdening the [manner
of] consciousness;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out gladdening the [maimer
of] consciousness.' (xi) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in concentrating the
[manner of] consciousness;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out concentrating the
[maimer of] consciousness.' (xii) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in liberating the
[manner of] consciousness;' he trains thus: T shall breathe out liberating the
[manner of] consciousness.'

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
"(xiii) He trains thus: T shall breathe in contemplating impermanence;' he
trains thus: 'I shall breathe out contemplating impermanence.' (xiv) He trains
thus: 'I shall breathe in contemplating fading away;' he trains thus: 'I shall
breathe out contemplating fading away.' (xv) He trains thus: T shall breathe in
contemplating cessation;' he trains thus: T shall breathe out contemplating
cessation.' (xvi) He trains thus: 'I shall breathe in contemplating relinquishment;'
he trains thus: T shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment' (S V 321-22).
146. The description [of development] is complete in all respects, however,
only if it is given in due course after a commentary on the text. So it is given here
(§186) introduced by a commentary on the [first part of the] text.
[Word Commentary]
And how developed, bhikkhus, how practiced much, is concentration through
mindfulness of breathing: here in the first place how is a question showing desire
to explain in detail the development of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing in its various forms. Developed, bhikkhus, ... is concentration through
mindfulness of breathing: this shows the thing that is being asked about out of
desire to explain it in its various forms. How practiced much ... as soon as they
arise?: here too the same explanation applies.
147.	Herein, developed means aroused or increased, concentration through
mindfulness of breathing (lit. "breathing-mindfulness concentration") is either
concentration associated with mindfulness that discerns breathing, or it is
concentration on mindfulness of breathing. Practiced much: practiced again and again.
148.	Both peaceful and sublime (santo c' eva panlto ca): it is peaceful in both
ways and sublime in both ways; the two words should each be understood as
governed by the word "both" (eva). What is meant? Unlike foulness, which as
a meditation subject is peaceful and sublime only by penetration, but is
neither (n' eva) peaceful nor sublime in its object since its object [in the learning
stage] is gross, and [after that] its object is repulsiveness—unlike that, this is
not unpeaceful or unsublime in any way but on the contrary it is peaceful,
i	7	ri	r-
stilled and quiet both on account of the peacefulness of its object and on
account of the peacefulness of that one of its factors called penetration. And
it is sublime, something one cannot have enough of, both on account of the
sublimeness of its object and on [268] account of the sublimeness of the
aforesaid factor. Hence it is called "both peaceful and sublime."
149. It is an unadulterated blissful abiding: it has no adulteration, thus it is
unadulterated; it is unalloyed, unmixed, particular, special. Here it is not a
question of peacefulness to be reached through preliminary work [as with the
kasinas] or through access [as with foulness, for instance]. It is peaceful and
sublime in its own individual essence too starting with the very first attention
given to it. But some38 say that it is "unadulterated" because it is unalloyed,
38. "'Some' is said with reference to the inmates of the Uttara (Northern) monastery
[in Anuradhapura]" (Vism-mht 256).
`261

Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
possessed of nutritive value and sweet in its individual essence too. So it should
be understood to be "unadulterated" and a "blissful abiding" since it leads to
the obtaining of bodily and mental bliss with every moment of absorption.
150.	As soon as they arise: whenever they are not suppressed. Evil: bad.
Unprofitable (akusala) thoughts: thoughts produced by unskilfulness (akosalla). It
banishes at once: it banishes, suppresses, at that very moment. Stills (vupasameti):
it thoroughly calms (sutthu upasameti); or else, when eventually brought to
fulfilment by the noble path, it cuts off, because ot partaking of penetration; it
tranquilizes, is what is meant.
151.	In brief, however, the meaning h|ere is this: "Bhikkhus, in what way, in
what manner, by what system, is concentration through mindfulness of breathing
developed, in what way is it practiced much, that it is both peaceful ... as soon as
they arise?"
152.	He now said, "Here, bhikkhus," etc., giving the meaning of that in detail.
Herein, here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu means: bhikkhus, in this dispensation a
bhikkhu. For this word here signifies the [Buddha's] dispensation as the
prerequisite for a person to produce concentration through mindfulness of
breathing in all its modes,39 and it denies that such a state exists in any other
dispensation. For this is said: "Bhikkhus, only here is there an ascetic, here a
second ascetic, here a third ascetic, here a fourth ascetic; other dispensations are
devoid of ascetics" (M I 63; A II 238).40 That is why it was said above "in this
dispensation a bhikkhu."
153.	Gone to the forest ... or to an empty place: this signifies that he has found an
abode favourable to the development of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing. For this bhikkhu's mind has long been dissipated among visible
data, etc., as its object, and it does not want to mount the object of concentration-
through-mindfuln|ess-of-breathing; it runs off the track like a chariot harnessed
to a wild ox.41 Now, suppose a cowherd [269] wanted to tame a wild calf that had
been reared on a wild cow's milk, he would take it awav from the cow and tie it
up apart with a rope to a stout post dug into the ground; then the calf might
i i	i	i	o--■-a-
dash to and fro, but being unable to get away it would eventually sit down or lie
down by the post. So too, when a bhikkhu wants to tame his own mind which
has long been spoilt by being reared on visible data, etc., as object for its food
and drink, he should take it away from visible data, etc., as object and bring it
into the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty place and tie it up there to the
post of in-breaths and out-breaths with the rope of mindfulness. And so his
mind may then dash to and fro when it no longer gets the objects it was formerly
39.	"The words 'in all its aspects' refer to the sixteen bases; for these are onlv found
in total in this dispensation. When outsiders know mindfulness of breathing they
only know the first foujr modes" (Vism-mht 257).
40.	"'The ascetic' is a stream-enterer, the 'second ascetic' is a once-returner, the
'third ascetic' is a non-returner, the 'fourth ascetic' is an Arahant" (M-a II 4).
41.	Kuta—"wild": PED, this ref. gives "useless," which misses the point. Cf. M-a II82;
IV 198. 
`262

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
used to, but being unable to break the rope of mindfulness and get away it sits
down, lies down, by that object under the influence of access and absorption.
Hence the Ancients said:
154.	"Just as a man who tames a calf
Would tie it to a post, so here
Should his own mind by mindfulness
Be firmly to the object tied."
This is how an abode is favourable to his development. Hence it was said
above: "This signifies that he has found an abode favourable to the development
of concentration through mindfulness of breathing."
155.	Or alternatively this mindfulness of breathing as a meditation subject—
which is foremost among the various meditation subjects of all Buddhas, [some]
Paccekabuddhas and [some] Buddhas' disciples as a basis for attaining
distinction and abiding in bliss here and now—is not easy to develop without
leaving the neighbourhood of villages, which resound with the noises of women,
men, elephants, horses, etc., noise being a thorn to jhana (see A V 135), whereas
in the forest awav from a village a meditator can at his ease set about discerning
this meditation subject and achieve the fourth jhana in mindfulness of breathing;
and then, by making that same jhana the basis for comprehension of formations
[with insight] (XX.2f.), he can reach Arahantship, the highest fruit. That is why
the Blessed One said "gone to the forest," etc., in pointing out a favourable
abode for him.
156. For the Blessed One is like a master of the art of building sites (see D I 9,
12; II 87). [270] As the master of the art of building sites surveys the proposed
site for a town, thoroughly examines it, and then gives his directions, "Build the
town here," and when the town is safely finished, he receives great honour from
the royal family so the Blessed One examines an abode as to its suitability for the
meditator, and he directs, "Devote yourself to the meditation subject here," and
later on, when the meditator has devoted himself to the meditation subject and
has reached Arahantship and says, "The Blessed One is indeed fully
enlightened," the Blessed One receives great honour.
157. And this bhikkhu is compared to a leopard. For just as a great leopard
king lurks in a grass wilderness or a jungle wilderness or a rock wilderness in
the forest and seizes wild beasts—the wild buffalo, wild ox, boar, etc.—so too,
the bhikkhu who devotes himself to his meditation subject in the forest, etc.,
should be understood to seize successively the paths of stream-entry once-return,
non-return, and Arahantship; and the njoble fruitions as well. Hence the Ancients
said:
"For as the leopard by his lurking [in the forest] seizes beasts
So also will this Buddhas' son, with insight gifted,
strenuous,
By his retreating to the forest seize the highest fruit
of all" (Mil 369).
`263
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
So the Blessed One said "gone to the forest," etc., to point out a forest abode as
a place likely to hasten his advancement.
158.	Herein, gone to the forest is gone to any kind of forest possessing the bliss
of seclusion among the kinds of forests characterized thus: "Having gone out
beyond the boundary post, all that is forest" (Patis I 176; Vibh 251), and "A forest
abode is five hundred bow lengths distant" (Vin IV 183). To the root of a tree: gone
to the vicinity of a tree. To an empty place: gone to an empty secluded space. And
here he can be said to have gone to an "empty place" if he has gone to any of the
remaining seven kinds of abode (resting place).42 [271]
159.	Having thus indicated an abode that is suitable to the three seasons,
suitable to humour and temperament,43 and favourable to the development of
mindfulness of breathing, he then said sits down, etc., indicating a posture that
is peaceful and tends neither to idleness nor to agitation. Then he said having
i-cf-cr
folded his legs crosswise, etc., to show firmness in the sitting position, easy occurrence
of the in-breaths and out-breaths, and the means for discerning the object.
160.	Herein, crosswise is the sitting position with the thighs fully locked. Folded:
having locked. Set his body erect: having placed the upper part of the body erect
with the eighteejn backbones resting end to end. For when he is seated like this,
his skin, flesh and sinews are not twisted, and so the feelings that would arise
moment by moment if they were twisted do not arise. That being so, his mind
becomes unified, and the meditation subject, instead of collapsing, attains to
growth and increase.
161.	Established mindfulness in front of him (parimukham satim upatthapetva) -
having placed (thapayitva) mindfulness (satim) facing the meditation subject
(kammatthanabhimukham). Or alternatively, the meaning can be treated here too
according to the method of explanation given in the Patisambhida, which is
this: Pari has the sense of control (pariggaha), mukhatn (lit. mouth) has the sense
of outlet (niyyana), sati has the sense of establishment (upatthana); that is why
parimukham satim ('mindfulness as a controlled outlet') is said" (Patis I 176). The
meaning of it in brief is: Having made mindfulness the outlet (from opposition,
forgetfulness being thereby] controlled.44
162. Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out: having seated himself
thus, having established mindfulness thus, the bhikkhu does not abandon that
mindfulness; ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out; he is a mindful
worker, is what is meant.
42.	The nine kinds of abode (resting place) are the forest and the root of a tree
already mentioned, and a rock, a hill cleft, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a jungle
thicket, an open space, a heap of straw (M I 181).
43.	"In the hot season the forest is favourable, in the cold season the root of a tree,
in the rainy season an empty place. For one of phlegmatic humour, phlegmatic by
nature, the forest is favourable, for one of bilious humour the root of a tree, for one of
windy humour an empty place. [For one of deluded temperament the forest, for one
of hating temperament the root of a tree, for one of greedy temperament an empty
place" (Vism-mht 258).
`264

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[Word Commentary Continued—First Tetrad]
163. (i) Now, breathing in long, etc., is said in order to show the different ways in
which he is a mindful worker. For in the Patisambhida, in the exposition of the
clause, "Ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out," this is said: "He
is a mindful worker in thirty-two ways: (1) when he knows unification of mind
and non-distraction by means of a long in-breath, mindfulness is established in
him; owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker. (2)
When he knows unification of mind and non-distraction by means of a long
out-breath ... (31) by means of breathing in contemplating relinquishment ...
(32) When he knows unification of mind and non-distraction by means of
breathing out contemplating relinquishment, mindfulness is established in him;
owing to that mindfulness and that knowledge he is a mindful worker" (Patis I
176).
164.Herein,	breathing in long (assasanto) is producing a long in-breath. [272]
"Assasa is the wind issuing out; passdsa is the wind entering in" is said in the
Vinaya Commentary. But in the Suttanta Commentaries it is given in the opposite
sense. Herein, when any infant comes out from the mother's womb, first the
wind from within goes out and subsequently the wind from without enters in
with fine dust, strikes the palate and is extinguished [with the infant's sneezing].
This, firstly is how assasa and passdsa should be understood.
165.	But their length and shortness should be understood by extent (addhana).
For just as water or sand that occupies an extent of space is called a "long water,"
a "long sand," a "short wajter," a "short sand," so in the case of elephants' and
snakes' bodies the in-breaths and out-breaths regarded as particles45 slowly fill
the long extent, in other words, their persons, and slowly go out again. That is
why they are called "long." They rapidly fill a short extent, in other words, the
person of a dog, a hare, etc., and rapidly go out again. That is why they are
called "short."
166.	And in the case of human beings some breathe in and breathe out long, by
extent of time, as elephants, snakes, etc., do, while others breathe in and breathe
out short in that way as dogs, hares, etc., do. Of these, therefore, the breaths that
travel over a long extent in entering in and going out are to be understood as
long in time; and the breaths that travel over a little extent in entering in and
going out, as short in time.
167. Now, this bhikkhu knows "I breathe in, I breathe out, long" while breathing
in and breathing out long in nine ways. And the development of the foundation
of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body should be understood
to be perfected in one aspect in him who knows thus, according as it is said in
the Patisambhida:
44.	The amplification is from Vism-mht 258.
45.	"'Regarded as particles': as a number of groups (kalapa)" (Vism-mht 259). This
conception of the occurrence of breaths is based on the theory of motion as "successive
arisings in adjacent locations" (desantaruppatti); see note 54 below. For "groups" see
XX.2f.

168. "How, breathing in long, does he know: T breathe in long/ breathing out
long, does he know: 'I breathe out long?' (1) He breathes in a long in-breath
reckoned as an extent. (2) He breathes out a long out-breath reckoned as an
extent. (3) He breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths
reckoned as an extent. As he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and
out-breaths reckoned as an extent, zeal arises.46 (4) Through zeal he breathes in
a long in-breath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. (5) Through zeal
he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent.
(6) Through zeal he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths
more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. As, through zeal, he breathes in
and breathes out long in-breaths and| out-breaths more subtle than before
reckoned as an extent, gladness arises. [273] (7) Through gladness he breathes
in a long in-breath more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. (8) Through
gladness he breathes out a long out-breath more subtle than before reckoned as
an extent. (9) Through gladness he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths
and out-breaths more subtle than before reckoned as an extent. As, through
gladness, he breathes in and breathes out long in-breaths and out-breaths more
subtle than before reckoned as an extent, his mind turns away from the long in-
breaths and out-breaths and equanimity is established.
"Long in-breaths and out-breaths in these nine ways are a body. The
establishment (foundation)47 is mindfulness. The contemplation is knowledge.
46. '"Zeal arises': additional zeal, which is profitable and has the characteristic of
desire to act, arises due to the satisfaction obtained when the meditation has brought
progressive improvement. 'More subtle than before': more subtle than before the
already-described zeal arose; for the breaths occur more subtly owing to the
meditation's influence in tranquilizing the body's distress and disturbance. 'Gladness
arises': fresh happiness arises of the kinds classed as minor, etc., which is the gladness
that accompanies the consciousness occupied with the meditation and is due to the
fact that the peacefulness of the object increases with the growing subtlety of the
breaths and to the fact that the meditation subject keeps to its course. 'The mind turns
away': the mind turns away from the breaths, which have reached the point at which
their manifestation needs investigating (see §177) owing to their gradually increasing
subtlety But some say (see Patis-a Ce, p. 351): Tt is when the in-breaths and out-
breaths have reached a subtler state owing to the influence of the meditation and the
counterpart sign; for when that has arisen, the mind turns away from the normal
breaths.' 'Equanimity is established': when concentration, classed as access and
absorption, has arisen in that counterpart s|ign, then, since there is no need for further
interest to achieve jhana, onlooking (equanimity) ensues, which is specific neutrality"
(Vism-mht 260).
47. "'hi these nine ways': that occur in the nine ways just described. 'Long in-breatlis
and out-breaths are a body': the in-breaths and out-breaths, which exist as particles
though they have the aspect of length, constitute a 'body' in the sense of a mass. And
here the sign that arises with the breaths as its support is also called 'in-breath and
out-breatli.' (cf. e.g. §206) 'The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness': mindfulness
is called 'establishment (foundation)—(upatthana)' since it approaches (upagantva) the
object and remains (titthati) there. 'The contemplation is knowledge': contemplation
`266
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the mindfulness.
Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness. By
means of that mindfulness and that knowledge h|e contemplates that body.
That is why 'development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness
consisting in contemplation of the body as a body' (see D II 290) is said" (Patis
I 177).
169. (ii) The same method of explanation applies also in the case of short
breaths. But there is this difference. While in the former case "a long in-breath
reckoned as an extent" is said, here "a short in-breath reckoned as a little
--
of the sign by means of serenity and contemplation of mentality-materiality by defining
with insight the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body which is their support, as
materiality and the consciousness and the states associated with it as the immaterial
(mentality), are knowledge, in other words, awareness of what is actually there (has
actually become). The body is the establishment (foundation)': there is that body and
mindfulness approaches it by making it its object and remains there, thus it is called
'establishment.' And the words 'the body is the establishment' include the other (the
mental) kind of body too since the above-mentioned comprehension by insight is
needed here too. 'But it is not the mindfulness': that body is not called 'mindfulness'
[though it is called 'the establishment']. 'Mindfulness is both the establishment
(foundation) and the mindfulness,' being so both in the sense of remembering (sarana)
and in the sense of establishing (upatitthana). 'By means of that mindfulness': by
means of that mindfulness already mentioned. 'And that knowledge': and the
knowledge already mentioned. 'That body': that in-breath-and-out-breath body and
that material body which is its support. 'He contemplates (anupassati)': he keeps re-
seeing (mm mm passati) with jhana knowledge and with insight knowledge. 'That is
why "Development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in
contemplation of the body as a body" is said': in virtue of that contemplation this is
said to be development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting
in contemplation of the body as a body of the kind already stated. What is meant is
this: the contemplation of the body as an in-breath-and-out-breath body as stated and
of the physical body that is its [material] support, which is not contemplation of
permanence, etc., in a body whose individual essence is impermanent, etc.—like the
contemplation of a waterless mirage as water—but which is rather contemplation of
its essence as impermanent, painful, not-self, and foul, according as is appropriate, or
alternatively, which is contemplation of it as a mere body only by not contemplating it
as containing anything that can be apprehended as T or 'mine' or 'woman' or 'man'—
all this is 'contemplation of the body' The mindfulness associated with that
contemplation of the body which mindfulness is itself the establishment, is the
'establishment.' The development, the increase, of that is the 'development of the
foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body'"
(Vism-mht 261)
The compound satipattliana is derived by the Patisambhida from sati (mindfulness)
and upattlidna (establishment—Patis I 182), but in the Commentaries the resolution
into sati and pattlidna (foundation) is preferred). (M-a 1237-38) In the 118th Sutta of the
Majjhima Nikava the first tetrad is called development of the first foundation of
mindfulness, or contemplation of the body. (MN 10; DN 22) The object of the
Patisambhida passage quoted is to demonstrate this.
`267
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
[duration]" (Patis I 182) is given. So it must be construed as "short" as far as the
phrase "That is why 'development of the foundation (establishment) of
mindfulness consisting in contemplation of the body as a body' is said" (Patis I
183).
170.	So it should be understood that it is when this bhikkhu knows in-breaths
and out-breaths in these nine ways as "a [long] extent" and as "a little [duration]"
that "breathing in long, he knows 'I breathe in long;' ... breathing out short, he
knows 'I breathe out short' is said of him. And when he knows thus:
"The long kind and the short as well,
The in-breath and the out-breath too,
Such then are the four kinds that happen
At the bhikkhu's nose tip here."
171.	(iii) He trains thus: "I shall breathe in ... I shall breathe out experiencing the
whole body": he trains thus: "I shall breathe in making known, making plain,
the beginning, middle and end48 of the entire in-breath body. I shall breathe out
making known, making plain, the beginning, middle and end of the entire out-
breath body," thus he trains. Making them known, making them plain, in this
way he both breathes in and breathes out with consciousness associated with
knowledge. That is why it is said, "He trains thus: T shall breathe in ... shall
breathe out ...'"
172. To one bhikkhu the beginning of the in-breath body or the out-breath
body distributed in particles, [that is to say regarded as successive arisings (see
note 45)] is plain, but not the middle or the end; he is only able to discern the
beginning and has difficulty with the middle and the end. To another the middle
is plain, not the beginning or the end; he is only able to discern the middle and
has difficulty with the beginning and the end. To another the end is plain, not
the beginning or the middle; he is only able to discern the end [274] and has
difficulty with the beginning and the middle. To yet another all stages are plain;
he is able to discern them all and has no difficulty with any of them. Pointing out
that one should be like the last-mentioned bhikkhu, he said: "He trains thus: T
shall breathe in ... shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.'"
173. Herein, he trains: he strives, he endeavours in this way. Or else the restraint
here in one such as this is training in the higher virtue, his consciousness is
training in the higher consciousness, and his understanding is training in the
higher understanding (see Patis I 184). So he trains in, repeats, develops,
repeatedly practices, these three kinds of training, on that object, by means of
that mindfulness, by means of that attention. This is how the meaning should be
regarded here.
--
48. The beginning, middle and end are described in §197, and the way they should
be treated is given in §199-201. What is meant is that the meditator should know what
thev are and be aware of them without his mindfulness leaving the tip of the nose to
follow after the breaths inside the body or outside it, speculating on what becomes of
them.
`268
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
174.	Herein, in the first part of the system (nos. i and ii)49 he should only
breathe in and breathe out and not do anything else at all, and it is onlv afterwards
that he should apply himself to the arousing of knowledge, and so on.
Consequently the present tense is used here in the text, "He knows: T breathe in'
... he knows: 'I breathe out.'" But the future tense in the passage beginning "I
shall breathe in experiencing the whole body" should be understood as used in
order to show that the aspect of arousing knowledge, etc., has to be undertaken
from then on.
175.	(iv) He trains thus: "I shall breathe in ... shall breathe out tranquilizing
the bodily formation;" he trains thus: "I shall breathe in, shall breathe out
tranquilizing, completely tranquilizing, stopping, stilling, the gross bodily
formation50".
176.	And here both the gross and subtle state and also [progressive]
tranquilizing should be understood. For previously, at the time when the bhikkhu
has still not discerned [the meditation subject], his body and his mind are
disturbed and so they are gross. And while the grossness of the body and the
mind has still not subsided the in-breaths and out-breaths are gross. They get
stronger; his nostrils become inadequate, and he keeps breathing in and out
through his mouth. But thev become quiet and still when his body and mind
have been discerned. When they are still then the in-breaths and out-breaths
occur so subtly that he has to investigate whether they exist or not.
177.	Suppose a man stands still after running, or descending from a hill, or
putting down a big load from his head, then his in-breaths and out-breaths are
gross, his nostrils become inadequate, and he keeps on breathing in and out
through his mouth. But when he has rid himself of his fatigue and has bathed
and drunk [275] and put a wet cloth on his heart, and is lying in the cool shade,
then his in-breaths and out-breaths eventually occur so subtly that he has to
investigate whether thev exist or not; so too, previously at the time when the
bhikkhu has still not discerned, ... he has to investigate whether they exist or not.
178.	Why is that? Because previously at the time when he has still not discerned,
there is no concern in him, no reaction, no attention, no reviewing, to the effect
that "I am [progressively] tranquilizing each grosser bodily formation." But
when he has discerned, there is. So his bodily formation at the time when he has
49.	"'In the first part of the system': in the first part of the system of development;
in the first two bases, is (what is intended. Of course, arousing of knowledge must be
admitted to take place here too because of the presence of awareness of the length
and shortness of the breaths as they actually are (as they actually become); and it is
not hard to do that, for it is merely the taking account of them as they occur. That is
why it is put in the present tense here. But what follows is as hard as for a man to walk
on a razor's edge; which is why the future tense is used for the subsequent stages in
order to indicate the need for exceptional prior effort" (Vism-mht 263).
50.	"'Bodily formation': the in-breath and out-breath (see M1301). For although it is
consciousness-originated, it is nevertheless called 'bodily formation' since its existence
is bound up with the kamma-bom body and it is formed with that as the means"
(Vism-mht 263).
`269
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
discerned is subtle in comparison with that at the time when he has not. Hence
the Ancients said:
"The mind and body are disturbed,
And then in excess it occurs;
But when the body is undisturbed,
Then it with subtlety occurs."
179. In discerning [the meditation subject the formation] is gross, and it is subtle
[by comparison] in the first-jhana access; also it is gross in that, and subtle [by
comparison] in the first jhana; in the first jhana and second-jhana access it is gross,
and in the second jhana subtle; in the second jhana and third-jhana access it is
gross, and in the third jhana subtle; in the third jhana and fourth-jhana access it is
gross, and in the fourth jhana it is so exceedingly subtle that it even reaches cessation.
This is the opinion of the Digha and Samyutta reciters. But the Majjhima reciters
have it that it is subtler in each access than in the jhana below too in this way: In the
first jhana it is gross, and in the second-jhana access it is subtle [bv comparison, and
so on]. It is, however, the opinion of all that the bodily formation occurring before the
time of discerning becomes tranquilized at the time of discerning, and the bodily
formation at the time of discerning becomes tranquilized in the first-jhana access ...
and the bodily formation occurring in the fourth-jhana access becomes tranquilized
in the fourth jhana. This is the method of explanation in the case of serenity
180. But in the case of insight, the bodilv formation occurring at the time of not
discerning is gross, and in discerning the primary elements it is [bv comparison]
subtle; that also is gross, and in discerning derived materiality it is subtle; that
also is gross, and in discerning all materiality it is subtle; that also is gross, and
in discerning the immaterial it is subtle; that also is gross, and in discerning the
material and immaterial it is subtle; that also is gross, and in discerning conditions
it is subtle; that also is gross, and in seeing mentality-materiality with its
conditions it is subtle; that also is gross, and in insight that has the characteristics
[of impermanence, etc.,] as its object it is subtle; that also is gross in weak insight
while in strong insight it is subtle.
Herein, the tranquilizing should be understood as [the relative tranquillity]
of the subsequent compared with the previous. Thus should the gross and subtle
state, and the [progressive] tranquilizing, be understood here. [276]
181. But the meaning of this is given in the Patisambhida together with the
objection and clarification thus:
"How is it that he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in ... shall breathe out
tranquilizing the bodily formation? What are the bodily formations? Long in-
breaths ... out-breaths [experiencing the whole body] belong to the body; these
things, being bound up with the body, are bodily formations;' he trains in
tranquilizing, stopping, stilling, those bodily formations.
"When there are such bodily formations whereby there is bending backwards,
sideways in all directions, and forwards, and perturbation, vacillation, moving
and shaking of the body, he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the
bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily
`270
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
formation.' When there are such bodily formations whereby there is no bending
backwards, sideways in all directions, and forwards, and no perturbation,
vacillation, moving and shaking of the body quietly subtly he trains thus: 'I
shall breathe in tranquilizing the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe
out tranquilizing the bodily formation.'
182.	"[Objection:] So then, he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing the
bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily
formation': that being so, there is no production of awareness of wind, and there
is no production of in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is no production of
mindfulness of breathing, and there is no production of concentration through
mindfulness of breathing, and consequently the wise neither enter into nor
emerge from that attainment.
183.	"[Clarification:] So then, he trains thus: 'I shall breathe in tranquilizing
the bodily formation;' he trains thus: 'I shall breathe out tranquilizing the bodily
formation': that being so, there is production of awareness of wind, and there is
production of in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is production of mindfulness
of breathing, and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing, and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment.
184. "Like what? Just as when a gong is struck. At first gross sounds occur
and consciousness [occurs] because the sign of the gross sounds is well
apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and when the gross sounds have
ceased, then afterwards faint sounds occur and [consciousness occurs] because
the sign of the faint sounds is well apprehended, well attended to, well observed;
and when the faint sounds have ceased, then [277] afterwards consciousness
occurs because it has the sign of the faint sounds as its object51—so too, at first
gross in-breaths and out-breaths occur and [consciousness does not become
distracted] because the sign of the gross in-breaths and out-breaths is well
apprehended, well attended to, well observed; and when the gross in-breaths
and out-breaths have ceased, then afterwards faint in-breaths and out-breaths
occur and [consciousness does not become distracted] because the sign of the
faint in-breaths and out-breaths is well apprehended, well attended to, well
observed; and when the faint in-breaths and out-breaths have ceased, then
afterwards consciousness does not become distracted because it has the sign of
the faint in-breaths and out-breaths as its object.

production of in-breaths and out-breaths, and there is production ot mindfulness
of breathing, and there is production of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing, and consequently the wise enter into and emerge from that attainment.
51. "The faint sound itself as a sign is the 'sign of the faint sounds'; it has that as its
object. What is meant? Of course, the faint sounds have ceased too then; but the sign
of the sounds has been well apprehended and so consciousness occurs with the sign
of fainter sounds as its object. For as from the outset he ascertains with undistracted
consciousness the sign of each sound as it ceases, eventually his consciousness occurs
in the end with the sign of ultra-subtle sounds too as its object" (Vism-mht 266).

Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
185.	"In-breaths and out-breaths tranquilizing the bodily formation are a body.
The establishment (foundation) is mindfulness. The contemplation is knowledge.
The body is the establishment (foundation), but it is not the mindfulness.
Mindfulness is both the establishment (foundation) and the mindfulness. Bv
means of that mindfulness and that knowledge he contemplates that body That
is why 'development of the foundation (establishment) of mindfulness consisting
in contemplation of the body as a body' is said" (Patis I 184-186).
This, in the first place, is the consecutive word commentary here on the first
tetrad, which deals with contemplation of the body
[Method of Development]
186.	The first tetrad is set forth as a meditation subject for a beginner;52 but the
other three tetrads are [respectively] set forth as the contemplations of feeling, of
[the manner of] consciousness, and of mental objects, for one who has already
attained jhana in this tetrad. So if a clansman who is a beginner wants to develop
this meditation subject, and through insight based on the fourth jhana produced
in breathing, to reach Arahantship together with the discriminations, he should
first do all the work connected with the purification of virtue, etc., in the way
already described, after which he should learn the meditation subject in five
stages from a teacher of the kind already described.
187.	Here are the five stages: learning, questioning, establishing, absorption,
characteristic.
Herein, learning is [learning the meditation subject. Questioning is questioning
about the meditation subject. Establishing is establishing the meditation subject.
Absorption [278] is the absorption of the meditation subject. Characteristic is the
characteristic of the meditation subject; what is meant is that it is the ascertaining
of the meditation subject's individual essence thus: "This meditation subject
has such a characteristic."
188.	Learning the meditation subject in the five stages in this way, he neither
tires himself nor worries the teacher. So in giving this meditation subject
consisting in mindfulness of breathing attention, he can live either with the
teacher or elsewhere in an abode of the kind already described, learning the
meditation subject in the five stages thus, getting a little expounded at a time
and taking a long time over reciting it. He should sever the minor impediments.
After finishing the work connected with the meal and getting rid of any
dizziness due to the meal, he should seat himself comfortably. Then, making
sure he is not confused about even a single word of what he has learned from
the teacher, he should cheer his mind by recollecting the special qualities of
the Three Jewels.
52. "As a meditation subject for a beginner" is said with reference to the serenity
(i.e. jhana) meditation subject; but the insight meditation subject applies to the other
tetrads too" (Vism-mht 266).
`272
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
189.	Here are the stages in giving attention to it: (1) counting, (2) connection,
(3) touching, (4) fixing, (5) observing, (6) turning away, (7) purification, and (8)
looking back on these.
Herein, counting is just counting, connection is carrying on, touching is the
place touched [by the breaths], fixing is absorption, observing is insight, turning
away is the path, purification is fruition, looking back on these is reviewing.
190.	2. Herein, this clansman who is a beginner should first give attention to
this meditation subject by counting. And when counting, he should not stop
short of five or go beyond ten or make any break in the series. Bv stopping short
of five his thoughts get excited in the cramped space, like a herd of cattle shut in
a cramped pen. By going beyond ten his thoughts take the number [rather than
the breaths] for their support. By making a break in the series he wonders if the
meditation subject has reached completion or not. So he should do his counting
without those faults.
191.	When counting, he should at first do it slowly [that is, late] as a grain
measurer does. For a grain measurer, having filled his measure, says "One," and
empties it, and then refilling it, he goes on saying '"One, one" while removing
any rubbish he may have noticed. And the same with "Two, two" and so on. So,
taking the in-breath or the out-breath, whichever appears [most plainly], he
should begin with "One, one" [279] and count up to "Ten, ten," noting each as
it occurs.
192.	As he does his counting in this way the in-breaths and out-breaths become
evident to him as thev enter in and issue out. Then he can leave off counting
slowly (late), like a grain measurer, and he can count quickly [that is, earlv] as a
cowherd does. For a skilled cowherd takes pebbles in his pocket and goes to the
cow pen in the morning, whip in hand; sitting on the bar of the gate, prodding
the cows in the back, he counts each one as it reaches the gate, saying "One,
two," dropping a pebble for each. And the cows of the herd, which have been
spending the three watches of the night uncomfortably in the cramped space,
come out quickly in parties, jostling each other as they escape. So he counts
XT7im3 CTCTT-IjlllV.IM v-irr^TTTTTrcDppTCnTITtg—CTTCTT—\7TTTCn CIO 11IV. V-CTTCTTJT^-(7U tTC-CTTTTITTIT
quickly (early) "Three, four, five" and so up to ten. In this way the in-breaths and
out-breaths, which had already become evident to him while he counted them in
the former way, now keep moving along quickly
193.	Then, knowing that they keep moving along quickly not apprehending
them either inside or outside [the body], but apprehending them just as they
reach the [nostril] door, he can do his counting quickly (early): "One, two, three,
four, five; one, two, three, four, five, six ... seven ... eight ... nine ... ten." For as
long as the meditation subject is connected with counting it is with the help of
that very counting that the mind becomes unified, just as a boat in a swift current
is steadied with the help of a rudder.
194.	When he counts quickly the meditation subject becomes apparent to him
as an uninterrupted process. Then, knowing that it is proceeding uninterruptedly
he can count quickly (earlv) in the way just described, not discerning the wind
either inside or outside [the body]. For by bringing his consciousness inside
along with the incoming breath, it seems as if it were buffeted by the wind inside
`273
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
or filled with fat.53 Bv taking his consciousness outside along with the outgoing
breath, it gets distracted by the multiplicity of objects outside. However, his
development is successful when he fixes his mindfulness on the place touched
[by the breaths]. That is why it was said above: "He can count quickly (early) in
the way just described, not discerning the wind either inside or outside."
195.	But how long is he to go on counting? Until, without counting, [280]
mindfulness remains settled on the in-breaths and out-breaths as its object. For
counting is simply a device for setting mindfulness on the in-breaths and out-
breaths as object by cutting off the external dissipation of applied thoughts.
196.	2. Having given attention to it in this wav by counting, he should now do
so by connection. Connection is the uninterrupted following of the in-breaths and
out-breaths with mindfulness after counting has been given up. And that is not
by following after the beginning, the middle and the end.54
197.	The navel is the beginning of the wind issuing out, the heart is its middle
and the nose-tip is its end. The nose-tip is the beginning of the wind entering in,
the heart is its middle and the navel is its end. And if he follows after that, his
mind is distracted by disquiet and perturbation according as it is said: "When
he goes in with mindfulness after the beginning, middle, and end of the in-
breath, his mind being distracted internally both his body and his mind are
disquieted and perturbed and shaky. When he goes out with mindfulness after
the beginning, middle and end of the out-breath, his mind being distracted
externally, both his body and his mind are disquieted and perturbed and shaky"
(Patis I 165).
3-4. So when he gives his attention to it by connection, he should do so not by
the beginning, middle and end, but rather by touching and by fixing.
198.	There is no attention to be given to it by touching separate from fixing as
there is by counting separate from connection. But when he is counting the
breaths in the place touched by each, he is giving attention to them by counting
53. "'Buffeted by wind': if he gives much attention to the wind that has gone inside,
that place seems to him as if it were buffeted by the wind, as if filled with fat" (Vism-
mht 268). No further explanation is given.
54. "'Following (anugamana)' is occurring along with (aim aim pavattana), going after
(anugacchand), by means of mindfulness through making the breaths the object as
thev occur, Hence he said, 'And that is not by following after the beginning, middle
and end.' 'The navel is the beginning' because of their first arising there. For the
notion of a beginning (adi cintd) is here in the sense of first arising, not in the sense of
just arising [once only]. For they actually go on arising throughout [the whole length]
from the navel to the nose-tip; and wherever they arise, there in that same place they
dissolve, because there is no going (movement) of dhammas. The ordinary term
'motion' (gatisamaniia) refers to successive arisings in adjacent locations
(desautaruppatti) according to conditions. 'The heart is the middle': near the heart, just
above it is the middle. 'The nose tip is the end': the place where the nostrils are is the
end; that is the limit of the application of the ordinary term 'in-breaths and out-
breaths,' for it is accordingly that they are called 'consciousness-originated,' there
being no production externally of what is consciousness-originated" (Vism-mht 268).
`274

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
and touching. When he has given up counting and is connecting them by
means of mindfulness in that same place and fixing consciousness by means of
absorption, then he is said to be giving his attention to them by connection,
touching and fixing. And the meaning of this may be understood through the
similes of the man who cannot walk and the gatekeeper given in the
commentaries, and through the simile of the saw given in the Patisambhida.
199. Here is the simile of the man who cannot walk: Just as a man unable to
walk, who is rocking a swing for the amusement of his children and their mother,
sits at the foot of the swing post and sees both ends and the middle of the swing
plank successively coming and going, [281] yet does not move from his place in
order to see both ends and the middle, so too, when a bhikkhu places himself
with mindfulness, as it were, at the foot of the post for anchoring [mindfulness]
and rocks the swing of the in-breaths and out-breaths; he sits down with
mindfulness on the sign at that same place, and follows with mindfulness the
beginning, middle and end of the in-breaths and out-breaths at the place touched
by them as they come and go; keeping his mind fixed there, he then sees them
without moving from his place in order to see them. This is the simile of the man
who cannot walk.
200.	This is the simile of the gatekeeper: Just as a gatekeeper does not examine
people inside and outside the town, asking, "Who are you? Where have you
come from? Where are you going? What have you got in your hand?"—for those
people are not his concern—but he does examine each man as he arrives at the
gate, so too, the incoming breaths that have gone inside and the outgoing breaths
that have gone outside are not this bhikkhu's concern, but they are his concern
each time they arrive at the [nostril] gate itself.
201.	Then the simile of the saw should be understood from its beginning. For
this is said:
"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object
Of a single consciousness;
By one who knows not these three things
Development is not obtained.
"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object
Of a single consciousness;
By one who does know these three things
Development can be obtained."
202. "How is it that these three things are not the object of a single
consciousness, that they are nevertheless not unknown, that the mind does not
become distracted, that he manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an
effect?
"Suppose there were a tree trunk placed on a level piece of ground, and a man
cut it with a saw. The man's mindfulness is established by the saw's teeth where
they touch the tree trunk, without his giving attention to the saw's teeth as they
approach and recede, though they are not unknown to him as they do so; and he
manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect. As the tree trunk
placed on the level piece of ground, so the sign for the anchoring of mindfulness.
`275
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
As the saw's teeth, so the in-breatlis and out-breaths. As the man's mindfulness,
established by the saw's teeth where they touch the tree trunk, without his
giving attention to the saw's teeth as they approach and recede, though they are
not unknown to him as they do so, and so he manifests effort, carries out a task,
and achieves an effect, [282] so too, the bhikkhu sits, having established
mindfulness at the nose tip or on the upper lip, without giving attention to the
in-breaths and out-breaths as they approach and recede, though they are not
unknown to him as they do so, and he manifests effort, carries out a task, and
achieves an effect.
203. "'Effort': what is the effort? The body and the mind of one who is energetic
become wieldy—this is the effort. What is the task? Imperfections come to be
abandoned in one who is energetic, and his applied thoughts are stilled—this is
the task. What is the effect? Fetters come to be abandoned in one who is energetic,
and his inherent tendencies come to be done away with—this is the effect.
"So these three things are not the object of a single consciousness, and thev
are nevertheless not unknown, and the mind does not become distracted, and he
manifests effort, carries out a task, and achieves an effect.
"Whose mindfulness of breathing in
And out is perfect, well developed,
And gradually brought to growth
According as the Buddha taught,
'Tis he illuminates the world
Just like the full moon free from cloud"55
This is the simile of the saw. But here it is precisely his not giving attention [to
the breaths] as [yet to] come and [already] gone56 that should be understood as
the purpose.
204.	When someone gives his attention to this meditation subject, sometimes it
is not long before the sign arises in him, and then the fixing, in other words,
absorption adorned with the rest of the jhana factors, [is achieved.
205.	After someone has given his attention to counting, then just as when a
body that is disturbed sits down on a bed or chair, the bed or chair sags down
and creaks and the cover gets rumpled, but when a body that is not disturbed
sits down, the bed or chair neither sags down nor creaks, the cover does not get
rumpled, and it is as though filled with cotton wool—why? because a body that
is not disturbed is light—so too, after he has given his attention to counting,
when the bodily disturbance has been stilled by the gradual cessation of gross
in-breaths and out-breaths, then both the body and the mind become light: the
physical body is as though it were ready to leap up into the air. [283]
206. When his gross in-breaths and out breaths have ceased, his consciousness
occurs with the sign of the subtle in-breaths and out-breaths as its object. And
when that has ceased, it goes on occurring with the successively subtler signs
as its object. How?

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
207.	Suppose a man stuck a bronze bell with a big iron bar and at once a loud
sound arose, his consciousness would occur with the gross sound as its object;
then, when the gross sound had ceased, it would occur afterwards with the sign
of the subtle sound as its object; and when that had ceased, it would go on
occurring with the sign of the successively subtler sounds as its object. This is
how it should be understood. And this is given in detail in the passage
beginning, "Just as when a metal gong is struck" (§184).
208.	For while other meditation subjects become clearer at each higher stage, this
one does not: in fact, as he goes on developing it, it becomes more subtle for him at
each higher stage, and it even comes to the point at which it is no longer manifest.
However, when it becomes unmanifest in this way, the bhikkhu should not
get up from his seat, shake out his leather mat, and go away What should be
done? He should not get up with the idea "Shall I ask the teacher?" or "Is my
meditation subject lost?"; for by going away and so disturbing his posture, the
meditation subject has to be started anew. So he should go on sitting as he was
and [temporarily] substitute the place [normally touched for the actual breaths
as the object of contemplation].57
209. These are the means for doing it. The bhikkhu should recognize the
unmanifest state of the meditation subject and consider thus: "Where do these
in-breaths and out-breaths exist? Where do they not? In whom do they exist? In
whom not?" Then, as he considers thus, he finds that they do not exist in one
inside the mother's womb, or in those drowned in water, or likewise in unconscious
beings,58 or in the dead, or in those attained to the fourth jhana, or in those born
into a fine-material or immaterial existence, or in those attained to cessation [of
perception and feeling]. So he should apostrophize himself thus: "You with all
your wisdom are certainly not inside a mother's womb or drowned in water or in
the unconscious existence or dead or attained to the fourth jhana or born into
the fine-material or immaterial existence or attained to cessation. Those in-breaths
and out-breath are actually existent in you, only you are not able to discern them
because your understanding is dull." Then, fixing his mind on the place
normally touched [by the breaths], he should proceed to give his attention to
that.
210. These in-breaths and out-breaths occur striking the tip of the nose in a
long-nosed man [284] and the upper lip in a short-nosed man. So he should fix
the sign thus: "This is the place where they strike." This was why the Blessed
One said: "Bhikkhus, I do not say of one who is forgetful, who is not fully aware,
[that he practices] development of mindfulness of breathing" (M III 84).
57.	The point made here is that if the breaths themselves get temporarily too faint to
be observed, he should carry on by observing the tip of the nose where they normally
touch until they become apparent again. He brings the meditation back to mind for
the moment, "as the place (desato)" where they were last noticed, instead of "as
breaths," which have temporarily vanished.

211.	Although any mjeditation subject, no matter what, is successful only in
one who is mindful and fully aware, yet any meditation subject other than this
one gets more evident as he goes on giving it his attention. But this mindfulness
of breathing is difficult, difficult to develop, a field in which only the minds of
Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and Buddhas' sons are at home. It is no trivial matter,
nor can it be cultivated by trivial persons. In proportion as continued attention is
given to it, it becomes more peaceful and more subtle. So strong mindfulness
and understanding are necessary here.
212.	Just as when doing needlework on a piece of fine cloth a fine needle is
needed, and a still finer instrument for boring the needle's eye, so too, when
developing this meditation subject, which resembles fine cloth, both the
mindfulness, which is the counterpart of the needle, and the understanding
associated with it, which is the counterpart of the instrument for boring the
needle's eye, need to be strong. A bhikkhu must have the necessary mindfulness
and understanding and must look for the in-breaths and out-breaths nowhere
else than the place normally touched by them.
213. Suppose a ploughman, after doing some ploughing, sent his oxen free to
graze and sat down to rest in the shade, then his oxen would soon go into the forest.
Now, a skilled ploughman who wants to catch them and yoke them again does not
wander through the forest following their tracks, but rather he takes his rope and
goad and goes straight to the drinking place where they meet, and he sits or lies
there. Then after the oxen have wandered about for a part of the day thev come to the
drinking place where thev meet and thev bathe and drink, and when he sees that
they have come out and are standing about, he secures them with the rope, and
prodding them with the goad, he brings them back, yokes them, and goes on with
his ploughing. So too, the bhikkhu should not look for the in-breaths and out-
breaths anywhere else than the place normally touched by them. And he should
take the rope of mindfulness and the goad of understanding, and fixing his mind
on the place normally touched bv them, he should go on giving his attention to that.
[285] For as he gives his attention in this way they reappear after no long time, as the
oxen did at the drinking place where they met. So he can secure them with the rope
of mindfulness, and yoking them in that same place and prodding them with the
goad of understanding, he can keep on applying himself to the meditation subject.
214.	When he does so in this way the sign59 soon appears to him. But it is not
the same for all; on the contrary, some say that when it appears it does so to
certain people producing a light touch like cotton or silk-cotton or a draught.
215.	But this is the exposition given in the commentaries: It appears to some
like a star or a cluster of gems or a cluster of pearls, to others with a rough touch
like that of silk-cotton seeds or a peg made of heartwood, to others like a long
braid string or a wreath of flowers or a puff of smoke, to others like a stretched-
59. "'The sign' is the learning sign and the counterpart sign, for both are stated here
together. Herein, the three similes beginning with cotton are properly the learning
sign, the rest are both. 'Some' are certain teachers. The similes beginning with the
'cluster of gems' are properly the counterpart sign" (Vism-mht 273).

out cobweb or a film of cloud or a lotus flower or a chariot wheel or the moon's
disk or the sun's disk.
216.	In fact this resembles an occasion when a number ot bhikkhus are sitting
together reciting a suttanta. When a bhikkhu asks, "What does this sutta appear
like to you?" one says, "It appears to me like a great mountain torrent," another
"To me it is like a line of forest trees," another "To me it is like a spreading fruit
tree giving cool shade." For the one sutta appears tjo them differently because of
the difference in their perception. Similarly this single meditation subject appears
differently because of difference in perception.60 It is born of perception, its source
is perception, it is produced by perception. Therefore it should be understood
that when it appears differently it is because ot difference in perception.
217.	And here, the consciousness that has in-breath as its object is one, the
consciousness that has out-breath as its object is another, and the consciousness
that has the sign as its object is another. For the meditation subject reaches
neither absorption nor even access in one who has not got these three things
[clear]. But it reaches access and also absorption in one who has got these three
things [clear]. For this is said:
"Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object
Of a single consciousness;
Bv one who knows not these three things
Development is not obtained.
Sign, in-breath, out-breath, are not object
Of a single consciousness;
By one who does know these three things
Development can be obtained" (Patis I 170). [286]
218. And when the sign has appeared in this way, the bhikkhu should go to
the teacher and tell him, "Venerable sir, such and such has appeared to me." But
[say the Dlgha reciters] the teacher should say neither "This is the sign" nor
"This is not the sign"; after saying "It happens like this, friend," he should tell
him, "Go on giving it attention again and again;" for if he were told "It is the
sign," he might [become complacent and] stop short at that (see M I 193f.), and
if he were told "It is not the sign," he might get discouraged and give up; so he
should encourage him to keep giving it his attention without saying either. So
the Dlgha reciters say, firstly. But the Majjhima reciters say that he should be
told, "This is the sign, friend. Well done. Keep giving attention to it again and
again."
219. Then he should fix his mind on that same sign; and so from now on, his
development proceeds by way of fixing. For the Ancients said this:
"Fixing his mind upon the sign
And putting away61 extraneous aspects,
--
60.	"'Because of difference in perception': because of the difference in the manner of
perceiving that occurred before the arising of the sign" (Vism-mht 273).
61.	Vibhdvayam can mean "to do away with" or "to explain." Either is applicable here
according to Vism-mht 274.

Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
The clever man anchors his mind
Upon the breathings in and out."
220.	So as soon as the sign appears, his hindrances are suppressed, his
defilements subside, his mindfulness is established, and his consciousness is
concentrated in access concentration.
221.	Then he should not give attention to the sign as to its colour, or review it
as to its [specific] characteristic. He should guard it as carefully as a king's
chief queen guards the child in her womb due to become a Wheel-turning
Monarch,62 or as a farmer guards the ripening crops; and he should avoid the
seven unsuitable things beginning with the unsuitable abode and cultivate the
seven suitable things. Then, guarding it thus, he should make it grow and improve
with repeated attention, and he should practice the tenfold skill in absorption
(IV42) and bring about evenness of energy (IV66).
222.	As he strives thus, fourfold and fivefold jhana is achieved bv him on that
same sign in the same way as described under the earth kasina.
5-8. (See §189) However, when a bhikkhu has achieved the fourfold and
fivefold jhana and wants to reach purity by developing the meditation subject
through observing and through turning away, he should make that jhana familiar
by attaining mastery in it in the five ways (IV131), and then embark upon insight
by defining mentality-materiality How?
223.	On emerging from the attainment, [287] he sees that the in-breaths and
out-breaths have the physical body and the mind as their origin; and that just as,
when a blacksmith's bellows are being blown, the wind moves owing to the bag
and to the man's appropriate effort, so too, in-breaths and out-breaths are due to
the body and the mind.
Next, he defines the in-breaths and out-breaths and the body as "materiality"
and the consciousness and the states associated with the consciousness as "the
immaterial [mind]." This is in brief (cf. M-a 1249); but the details will be explained
later in the defining of mentality-materiality (XVIII.3f.).
224. Having defined mentality-materiality in this way he seeks its condition.
With search he finds it, and so overcomes his doubts about the way of mentality-
materiality's occurrence in the three divisions of time (Ch. XIX).
His doubts being overcome, he attributes the three characteristics [beginning
with that of suffering to mentality and materiality], comprehending [them] by
groups (XX.2f.); he abandons the ten imperfections of insight beginning with
illumination, which arise in the first stages ot the contemplation of rise and fall
(XX.105f.), and he defines as "the path" the knowledge of the way that is free
from these imperfections (XX.126f.).
He reaches contemplation of dissolution by abandoning [attention to] arising.
When all formations have appeared as terror owing to the contemplation of their
incessant dissolution, he becomes dispassionate towards them (Ch. XXI), his
greed for them fades away and he is liberated from them (Ch. XXII).

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
After he has [thus] reached the four noble paths in due succession and has
become established in the fruition of Arahantship, he at last attains to the nineteen
kinds of reviewing knowledge (XXII.19f.), and he becomes fit to receive the
highest gifts from the world with its deities.
225.	At this point his development of concentration through mindfulness of
breathing, beginning with counting and ending with looking back (§189) is
completed.
This is the commentary on the first tetrad in all aspects.
[Word Commentary Continued—Second Tetrad]
226.	Now, since there is no separate method for developing the meditation
subject in the case of the other tetrads, their meaning therefore needs only to be
understood according to the word commentary.
(v) He trains thus: "I shall breathe in ... shall breathe out experiencing happiness,"
that is, making happiness known, making it plain. Herein, the happiness is
experienced in two ways: (a) with the object, and (b) with non-confusion.63
227.	(a) How is the happiness experienced with the object? He attains the two
jhanas in which happiness is present. At the time when he has actually entered
upon them the happiness is experienced with the object owing to the obtaining
of the jhana, because of the experiencing of the object, (b) How with non-
confusion? When, after entering upon and emerging from one of the two jhanas
accompanied by happiness, [288] he comprehends with insight that happiness
associated with the jhana as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual
time of the insight the happiness is experienced with non-confusion owing to
the penetration of its characteristics [of impermanence, and so on].
228.	For this is said in the Patisambhida: "When he knows unification of mind
and non-distraction through long in-breaths, mindfulness is established in him.
By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is experienced.
When he knows unification of mind and non-distraction through long out-
breaths ... through short in-breaths ... through short out-breaths ... through in-
breaths ... out-breaths experiencing the whole body ... through in-breaths ...
out-breaths tranquilizing the bodily formation, mindfulness is established in
63. "'With the object': under the heading of the object. The h|appiness included in the
jhana that has that object is experienced 'because of the experiencing of the object.'
What is meant? Just as, when a man who is looking for a snake discovers (experiences)
its abode, the snake is, as it were, already discovered (experienced) and caught, owing
to the ease with which he will then be able to catch it with charms and spells, so too,
when the object, which is the abode of the happiness, is experienced (discovered),
then the happiness itself is experienced (discovered) too, owing to the ease with which
it will be apprehended in its specific and general characteristics. 'Bv his penetration of
its characteristics': by penetration of the specific and general characteristics of
happiness. For when the specific and general characteristics of anything are
experienced then that thing is experienced according to reality" (Vism-mht 276).
`281

him. By means of that mindfulness and that knowledge that happiness is
experienced.
"It is experienced by him when he adverts, when he knows, sees, reviews,
steadies his mind, resolves with faith, exerts energy, establishes mindfulness,
concentrates his mind, understands with understanding, directly knows what
is to be directly known, fully understands what is to be fully understood,
abandons what is to be abandoned, develops what is to be developed, realizes
what is to be realized. It is in this way that that happiness is experienced" (Patis
I 187).
229. (vi-viii) The remaining [three] clauses should be understood in the same
way as to meaning; but there is this difference here. The experiencing of bliss must
be understood to be through three jhanas, and that of the mental formation through
four. The mental formation consists of the two aggregates of feeling and
perception. And in the case of the clause, experiencing bliss, it is said in the
r — — r	-™	-7——|—--------^ --------r — — ------- —----
Patisambhida in order to show the plane of insight here [as well]: "'Bliss': there
are two kinds of bliss, bodily bliss and mental bliss" (Patis I 188). Tranquilizing
the mental formation: tranquilizing the gross mental formation; stopping it, is the
meaning. And this should be understood in detail in the same way as given
under the bodily formation (see §§176-85).
230.	Here, moreover, in the "happiness" clause feeling [which is actually being
contemplated in this tetrad] is stated under the heading of "happiness" [which
is a formation] but in the "bliss" clause feeling is stated in its| own form. In the
two "mental-formation" clauses the feeling is that [necessarily] associated with
perception because of the words, "Perception and feeling belong to the mind,
these things being bound up with the mind are mental formations" (Patis 1188).
[289]
So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of feeling.
[Word Commentary Continued—Third Tetrad]
231.	(ix) In the third tetrad the experiencing of the [manner of] consciousness must
be understood to be through four jhanas.
(x) Gladdening the [manner of] consciousness: he trains thus: "Making the mind
glad, instilling gladness into it, cheering it, rejoicing it, I shall breathe in, shall
breathe out." Herein, there is gladdening in two ways, through concentration
and through insight.
How through concentration? He attains the two jhanas in which happiness
is present. At the time when he has actually entered upon them he inspires the
mind with gladness, instils gladness into it, by means of the happiness associated
with the jhana. How through insight? After entering upon and emerging from
one of the two jhanas accompanied by happiness, he comprehends with insight
that happiness associated with the jhana as liable to destruction and to fall; thus
at the actual time of insight he inspires the mind with gladness, instils gladness
into it, by making the happiness associated with the jhana the object. It is of one
`282
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (fiamadhi)
progressing in this way that the words, "He trains thus: T shall breathe in ...
shall breathe out gladdening the [manner of] consciousness/" are said.
232.	(xi) Concentrating (samadaham) the [manner of\ consciousness: evenly (samam)
placing (adahanto) the mind, evenly putting it on its object bv means of the first
jhana and so on. Or alternatively when, having entered upon those jhanas and
emerged from them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated
with the jhana as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of
insight momentary unification of the mind64 arises through the penetration of
the characteristics [of impermanence, and so on]. Thus the words, "He trains
thus: T shall breathe in ... shall breathe out concentrating the [manner of]
consciousness/" are said also of one who evenlv places the mind, evenly puts it
on its object by means of the momentary unification of the mind arisen thus.
233.	(xii) Liberating the [manner of] consciousness: he both breathes in and breathes
out delivering, liberating, the mind from the hindrances by means of the first
----- ™ • —O'------------O' ------------ ----------------------------------------- — ---------
jhana, from applied and sustained thought by means of the second, from
happiness by means of the third, from pleasure and pain by means of the fourth.
Or alternatively, when, having entered upon those jhanas and emerged from
them, he comprehends with insight the consciousness associated with the jhana
as liable to destruction and to fall, then at the actual time of insight he delivers,
liberates, the mind from the perception of permanence by means of the
contemplation of impermanence, from the perception of pleasure by means of
the contemplation of pain, from the perception of self by means of the
contemplation of not self, from delight by means of the contemplation of
dispassion, from greed by means of the contemplation of fading away, from
arousing bv means of the contemplation of cessation, from grasping by means
of the contemplation of relinquishment. Hence it is said: [290] "He trains thus: T
shall breathe in ... shall breathe out liberating the [manner of] consciousness.65
So this tetrad should be understood to deal with contemplation of mind.
--
64. "'Momentary unification of the mind': concentration lasting only for a moment.
For that too, when it occurs uninterruptedly on its object in a single mode and is not
overcome by opposition, fixes the mind immovably, as if in absorption" (Vism-mht
278).
65. "'Delivering': secluding, separating, by means of deliverance consisting in
suppression; abandoning the hindrances, is the meaning. 'At the actual time of
insight': at the time of contemplation of dissolution. For dissolution is the furthest
extreme of impermanence. So the meditator who is contemplating dissolution by
its means sees under the heading of consciousness the whole field of formations
as impermanent, not as permanent; and because of the suffering inherent in what
is impermanent, and because of the absence of self in what is painful, he sees that
same whole field of formations as painful, not as pleasant, and as not-self, not as
self. But since what is impermanent, painful, and not-self is not something to
delight in, and what is not something to delight in is not something to be greedy
for, consequently he becomes dispassionate towards that whole field of formations
when it is seen in the light of dissolution as impermanent, painful, not-self, he
does not delight in it, and his greed for it fades away does not dye him. Now, as he
thus becomes dispassionate and his greed fades away it is firstly by means of

[Word Commentary Continued—Fourth Tetrad]
234. (xiii) But in the fourth tetrad, as to contemplating impermanence, here firstly
the impermanent should be understood, and impermanence, and the
contemplation of impermanence, and one contemplating impermanence.
Herein, the five aggregates are the impermanent. Why? Because their essence
is rise and fall and change. Impermanence is the rise and fall and change in those
same aggregates, or it is their non-existence after having been; the meaning is, it
is the breakup of produced aggregates through their momentary dissolution
since they do not remain in the same mode. Contemplation of impermanence is
contemplation of materiality, etc., as "impermanent" in virtue of that
impermanence. One contemplating impermanence possesses that contemplation.
So it is when one such as this is breathing in and breathing out that it can be
understood of him: "He trains thus: T shall breathe in ... shall breathe out
contemplating impermanence.'"66
--
mundane knowledge only that he causes greed to cease and does not arouse it. The
meaning is that he does not bring about its arising. Or alternatively his greed having
thus faded away he causes by means of his own knowledge the cessation of the
unseen field of formations just as that of the seen, he does not arouse it; the meaning
is that he brings about only its cessation, he does not bring about its arising. Having
entered on this way he relinquishes, he does not grasp. What is meant? It is that tills
contemplation of impermanence, etc., is called relinquishment as giving up and
relinquishment as entering into because it gives up defilements along with aggregate-
producing kamma-formations and because, by seeing the flaws in what is formed and
by inclining towards the opposite of what is formed, namely Nibbana, it enters into
that Nibbana. Consequently the meditator who has that contemplation gives up
defilements and enters into Nibbana in the way stated. Herein, the contemplation of
what is impermanent as only impermanent is 'contemplation of impermanence'; this
is a name for insight that occurs by taking formations of the three [mundane] planes
[and leaving aside the supramundane] as impermanent. 'From the perception of
permanence': from the wrong perception that occurs perceiving formed things as
permanent, eternal; also the various views should be regarded as included under the
heading of perception. Likewise with the perception of pleasure and so on. 'Bv means
of the contemplation of dispassion': by means of the contemplation that occurs in the
mode of dispassion for formations. 'From delight': from craving accompanied by
happiness. 'By means of the contemplation of fading away': by means of the
contemplation that occurs similarly in the mode of fading away; hence 'delivering
from greed' is said. 'By means of the contemplation of cessation': by means of the
successive seeing of formations' cessation. Or contemplating cessation is contemplation
such that formations cease only and do not arise with future renewal. For this is
knowledge of desire for deliverance grown strong. Hence he said, 'delivering from
arousing.' Contemplation that occurs in th|e mode of relinquishing is 'contemplation
of relinquishment.' 'From grasping': from taking as permanent, etc.; or the meaning
can also here be regarded as 'from grasping rebirth-linking.' (Vism-mht 279) See
Chapters XX and XXI.
66. "What is called 'permanent' is what is lasting, eternal, like Nibbana. What is
called 'impermanent' is what is not permanent, and is possessed of rise and fall. He
said 'The five aggregates are "the impermanent,"' signifying that they are formed
`284
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
235.	(xiv) Contemplating fading away: there are two kinds of fading away that is,
fading away as destruction, and absolute fading away.67 Herein, "fading away
as destruction" is the momentary dissolution of formations. "Absolute fading
away" is Nibbana. Contemplation of fading away is insight and it is the path,
w|hich occurs as the seeing of these two. It is when he possesses this twofold
contemplation that it can be understood of him: "He trains thus: T shall breathe
in ... shall breathe out contemplating fading away.'"
(xv) The same method of explanation applies to the clause, contemplating
cessation.
236.	(xvi) Contemplating relinquishment: relinquishment is of two kinds too, that
is to say relinquishment as giving up, and relinquishment as entering into.
Relinquishment itself as [a way of] contemplation is "contemplation of
relinquishment." For insight is called both "relinquishment as giving up" and
"relinquishment as entering into" since [firstly], through substitution of opposite
------1	o **—	t	T j r ---o— —'— --------r r ——
qualities, it gives up defilements with their aggregate-producing kamma
formations, and [secondly], through seeing the wretchedness of what is formed,
it also enters into Nibbana by inclining towards Nibbana, which is the opposite
of the formed (XI. 18). Also the path is called both "relinquishment as giving up"
and "relinquishment as entering into" since it gives up defilements with their
aggregate-producing kamma-formations by cutting them off, and it enters into
Nibbana by making it its object. Also both [insight and path knowledge] are
called contemplation (anupassa\id) because ot their re-seeing successively (arm
anil yassana) each preceding kind of knowledge.68 [291] It is when he possesses
--
dhammas as to meaning. Why? 'Because their essence is rise and fall and change': the
meaning is that their individual essences have rise and fall and change. Herein, formed
dhammas' arising owing to cause and condition, their coming to be after non-existence,
their acquisition of an individual self (attalabha), is 'rise.' Their momentary cessation
when arisen is 'fall.'
67. "'Destruction' is the vanishing of formations; it is the act of those formations'
fading away, their disintegration, that is 'fading away.' Destruction itself as fading away
is 'fading away as destruction'; this is momentary cessation. Formations fade away
absolutely here when this has been reached, thus it is 'absolute fading away;' tills is
Nibbana" (Vism-mht 280).
68. "The act of relinquishing as the act of giving up by means of substituting for
what should be abandoned its opposite quality or by cutting it off, is 'relinquishment
as giving up' Likewise the act of relinquishing of self that takes place in non-formation
of kamma, which is the relinquishing of all substrata (circumstances) of becoming,
being the entering into that [Nibbana] either by inclination towards it [in insight] or by
having it as object [in the path] is 'relinquishment as entering into.' 'Through
substitution of opposite qualities': here contemplation of impermanence, firstly, gives
up perception of permanence by abandoning through substitution of the opposite
[e.g. substituting perception of impermanence for that of permanence in the case of all
formed things]. And the giving up in this way is in the form of inducing non-occurrence.
For all kamma-formations that ar|e rooted in defilements due to apprehending
(formations) as permanent, and the kamma-resultant aggregates rooted in both which
might arise in the future, are abandoned by causing their non-occurrence. Likewise in
`285
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
this twofold contemplation that it can be understood of him: "He trains thus: T
shall breathe in ... shall breathe out contemplating relinquishment.'"
237.	This tetrad deals only with pure insight while the previous three deal
with serenity and insight. This is how the development of mindfulness of
breathing with its sixteen bases in four tetrads should be understood.
[Conclusion]
This mindfulness of breathing with its sixteen bases thus is of great fruit, of
great benefit.
238.	Its great beneficialness should be understood here as peacefulness both
because of the words, "And, bhikkhus, this concentration through mindfulness
of breathing, when developed and much practiced, is both peaceful and sublime"
(S V 321), etc., and because of its ability to cut off applied thoughts; for it is
7	"r i	o 7
because it is peaceful, sublime, and an unadulterated blissful abiding that it cuts
off the mind's running hither and thither with applied thoughts obstructive to
concentration, and keeps the mind only on the breaths as object. Hence it is said:
"Mindfulness of breathing should be developed in order to cut off applied
thoughts" (A IV 353).
239.	Also its great beneficialness should be understood as the root condition
for the perfecting of clear vision and deliverance; for this has been said by the
Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, mindfulness of breathing, when developed and much
practiced, perfects the four foundations of mindfulness. The four foundations of
mindfulness, when developed and much practiced, perfect the seven
enlightenment factors. The seven enlightenment factors, when developed and
much practiced, perfect clear vision and deliverance" (M III 82).
240.	Again its great beneficialness should be understood to reside in the fact
that it causes the final in-breaths and out-breaths to be known; for this is said by
the Blessed One: "Rahula, when mindfulness of breathing is thus developed,
thus practiced much, the final in-breaths and out-breaths, too, are known as they
cease, not unknown" (M I 425f.).
241. Herein, there are three kinds of [breaths that are] final because of cessation,
that is to say final in becoming, final in jhana, and final in death. For, among the
various kinds of becoming (existence), in-breaths and out-breaths occur in the
sensual-sphere becoming, not in the fine-material and immaterial kinds of
becoming. That is why there are final ones in becoming. In the jhanas they occur
the case of perception of pain, and so on. Through seeing the wretchedness of what
is formed': through seeing the fault of impermanence, etc., in the formed three-plane
field of formations. It is 'the opposite of the formed' owing to its permanence, and so
on. When defilements are given up by the path, then kamma-formations are called
'given up' through producing (apadana) in them the nature of not causing result, and
aggregates rooted in them are called 'giv|en up' through their being rendered fit for
non-arising. So the path gives up all these, is what is meant" (Vism-mht 281). The
word pakkJiandana (rendered by "entering into") is used to define the act of faith, and
can also be rendered by "launching out into" or by "leap."
`286
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
in the first three but not in the fourth. That is why there are final ones in jhana.
Those that arise along with the sixteenth consciousness preceding the death
consciousness [292] cease together with the death consciousness. They are called
"final in death." It is these last that are meant here by "final."
242.	When a bhikkhu has devoted himself |to this meditation subject, it seems,
if he adverts, at the moment of arising of the sixteenth consciousness before the
death consciousness, to their arising, then their arising is evident to him; if he
adverts to their presence, then their presence is evident to him; if he adverts to
their dissolution, then their dissolution is evident to him; and it is so because he
has thoroughly discerned in-breaths and out-breaths as object.
243.	When a bhikkhu has attained Arahantship by developing some other
meditation subject than this one, he may be able to define his life term or not. But
when he has reached Arahantship by developing this mindfulness of breathing
with its sixteen bases, he can always define his life term. He knows, "My vital
formations will continue now for so long and no more." Automatically he performs
all the functions of attending to the body, dressing and robing, etc., after which
he closes his eyes, like the Elder Tissa who lived at the Kotapabbata Monastery,
like the Elder Maha Tissa who lived at the Maha Karanjiya Monastery like the
Elder Tissa the alms-food eater in the kingdom of Devaputta, like the elders who
were brothers and lived at the Cittalapabbata monastery.
244. Here is one story as an illustration. After reciting the Patimokkha, it seems,
on the Uposatha day of the full moon, one of the two elders who were brothers
went to his own dwelling place surrounded by the Community of Bhikkhus. As
he stood on the walk looking at the moonlight he calculated his own vital
formations, and he said to the Communitv of Bhikkhus, "In what way have you
seen bhikkhus attaining Nibbana up till now?" Some answered, "Till now we
have seen them attain Nibbana sitting in their seats." Others answered, "We
have seen them sitting cross-legged in the air." The elder said, "I shall now
show you one attaining Nibbana while walking." He then drew a line on the
walk, saying, "I shall go from this end of the walk to the other end and return;
when I reach this line I shall attain Nibbana." So saying, he stepped on to the
walk and went to the far end. On his return he attained Nibbana in the same
moment in which he stepped on the line. [293]
So let a man, if he is wise,
Untiringly devote his days
To mindfulness of breathing, which
Rewards him always in these ways.
This is the section dealing with mindfulness of breathing in the detailed
explanation.
[(10) Recollection of Peace]
245. One who wants to develop the recollection of peace mentioned next to
mindfulness of breathing (III. 105) should go into solitary retreat and recollect
the special qualities of Nibbana, in other words, the stilling of all suffering, as
follows:
`287
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
"Bhikkhus, in so far as there are dhammas, whether formed or unformed,
fading away is pronounced the best of them, that is to say, the disillusionment of
vanity, the elimination of thirst, the abolition of reliance, the termination of the
round, the destruction of craving, fading away cessation, Nibbana" (A II 34).
246. Herein in so far as means as many as. Dhammas [means] individual
essences.69 Whether formed or unformed: whether made by conditions going
--
69. "In such passages as 'Dhammas that are concepts' (Dhs p. 1, §1308) even a non-
entity (abhdva) is thus called a 'dhamma' since it is borne (dhdrlyati) and affirmed
(avadharlyati) by knowledge. That kind of dhamma is excluded by his saying, 'Dhammas
[means] individual essences.' The act of becoming (bhavana), which constitutes existing-
ness (vijjamdnatd) in the ultimate sense, is essence (bhava); it is with essence (saha
bhdvena), thus it is an individual essence (sabhdva); the meaning is that it is possible
(labbhamdnarupa) in the true sense, in the ultimate sense. For these are called 'dhammas
(bearers)' because they bear (dhdrana) their own individual essences (sabhdva), and
they are called 'individual essences' in the sense already explained" (Vism-mht 282;
cf. Ch. VII, 11. 1).
In the Pitakas the word sabhava seems to appear only once (Patis II 178). It next
appears in the Netti (p.79), the Milindapanlia (pp. 90, 164, 212, 360). It is extensively
used for exegetical purposes in the Visnddhirnagga and main commentaries and likewise
in the subcommentaries. As has just been shown, it is narrower than dhamma (see
also Ch. XXIII. n. 18). It often roughly corresponds to dhatn (element—see e.g. Dhs-a
263) and to lakkltana (characteristic—see below), but less nearly to the vaguer and (in
Pali) untechnical pakati (nature), or to rasa (function—see 1.21). The AtthasdlinT observes:
"It is the individual essence, or the generality of such and such dhammas that is called
their characteristic" (Dhs-a 63); on which the Miila Tlkd comments: "The individual
essence consisting in, say, hardness as that of earth, or touching as that of contact, is
not common to all dhammas. The generality is the individual essence common to all
consisting in impermanence, etc.; also in this context (i.e. Dhs §1) the characteristic of
being profitable may be regarded as general because it is the individual essence
common to all that is profitable; or alternatively it is their individual essence because it
is not common to the unprofitable and indeterminate [kinds of consciousness]" (Dlis-
a 63). The individual essence of any formed dliamma is manifested in the three instants
of its existence (atthita, vijjanianata), namely arising, presence (= aging) and dissolution.
It comes from nowhere and goes nowhere (XV15) and is borne by the mind. Dhammas
without individual essence (asabhavadhamma) include the attainment of cessation (see
Ch. XXIII, n. 18) and some concepts. Space and time belong to the last-mentioned. Of
space (akasa) the Majjhima Nikdya Tika says: "Space, which is quite devoid of individual
essence, is called empty" (commenting on MN 106), while of time (killa) the Mfda Tika
says: "Though time is determined by the kind of consciousness [e.g. as specified in
the first paragraph of the Dhammasariganl] and is non-existent (avijjamana) as to
individual essence, yet as the non entity (abhava) before and after the moment in
which those [conascent and co-present] dhammas occur, it is called the 'container
(adlrikarana)'; it is perceived (symbolized) only as the) state of a receptacle (adhara-blmva)
(Dhs-a 62). Of Nibbana (for which see XVI.46ff.), which has its own individual essence, the
Milla Tika says "Nibbana is not like other dhammas; because of its extreme profundity it
cannot be made an object of consciousness (alanibihitn) by one who has not realized it.
That is why it has to be realized by change-of-lineage. It has profundity surpassing any
individual essence belonging to the three periods of time" (Vibh-a 38).

together, coming together, or not so made.70 Fading away is pronounced the best of
them: of these formed and unformed dhammas, fading away is pronounced the
best, is called the foremost, the highest.
247. Herein fading away is not mere absence of greed, but rather it is that
unformed dhamma which, while [given the names "disillusionment of vanity"
etc., in the clause, "that is to say the disillusionment of vanity ... Nibbana," is
treated basically as fading away.71 It is called disillusionment of vanity because on
coming to it all kinds of vanity (intoxication), such as the vanity of conceit, and
vanity of manhood, are disillusioned, undone, done away with.72 And it is called
elimination of thirst because on coming to it all thirst for sense desires is eliminated
and quenched. But it is called abolition of reliance because on coming to its
reliance on the five cords of sense desire is abolished. It is called termination of the
round because on coming to it the round of the three planes [of existence] is
terminated. It is called destruction of craving because on coming to it craving is
--
Sablidva has not the extreme vagueness of its parent bhava, which can mean anything
between "essence" (see e.g. Dhs-a 61) and "-ness" (e.g. natthibhava - non-existingness—
X.35). This may be remembered when sablidva is defined as above thus: "It is with
essence (sahabhdvena), thus it is individual essence (sablidva)" (Vism-mht 282), and
when it is defined again thus: "A dhamma's own essence or its existing essence (sako
vd blidvo samdno vd blidvo) is its individual essence (sablidva)" (Vism-mht 433). Sablidva
can also be the basis of a wrong view, if regarded as the sole efficient cause or
condition of any formed thing (Ch. XVI, n.23). The Sanskrit equivalent, svabhdva, had
a great vogue and checkered history in philosophical discussions on the Indian
mainland.
This (unlike the word, dhamma, which has many "referents") is an instance in which
it is of first importance to stick to one rendering. The word is a purely exegetical one;
consequently vagueness is undesirable. "Individual essence" has been chosen
principally on etymological grounds, and the word "essence" (an admittedly slippery
customer) must be understood from the contexts in which it is used and not prejudged.
Strictly it refers here to the triple moment of arising etc., of formed dhammas that can
have such "existence" in their own right and be experienced as such; and it refers to
the realizability of Nibbana. We are here in the somewhat magical territory of ontology,
a subject that is at present undergoing one of its periodical upheavals in Europe, this
time in the hands of the existentialists. Consequently it is important to approach the
subject with an open mind.
70.	"'Made' is generated. 'Not so made' is not made by any conditions at all."
(Vism-mht 281)
71.	"That dhamma possessing individual essence and having the characteristic of
being not formed is to be treated basically as 'fading away' since it is there that the
dhamma of defilement fades away" (Vism-mht 282).
72.	"When they are being abandoned by the noble path, which occurs by making
Nibbana its object, it is said that they are abandoned by reaching that [Nibbana] which
is why he said, 'Because on coming to it,' and so on. Herein, 'vanity of conceit (niaria-
mada)' is conceit (mana) that occurs as conceiving (niannana) T am superior' (Vibh 353).
'Vanity of manhood' is vanity about being of the male sex. The words 'such as' refer
to vanity of birth, and so on (Vibh 345)" (Vism-mht 282).
`289
Chapter VIII
Other Recollections as Meditation Subjects
entirely destroyed, fades away and ceases. It is called Nibbana (extinction) because
it has gone away from (nikkhanta), has escaped from (nissata), is dissociated from
craving, which has acquired in common usage the name "fastening" (vana)
because, by ensuring successive becoming, craving serves as a joining together,
a binding together, a l|acing together, of the four kinds of generation, five destinies,
seven stations of consciousness and nine abodes of beings.73 [294]
248. This is how peace, in other words, Nibbana, should be recollected
according to its special qualities beginning with disillusionment of vanity But
it should also be recollected according to the other special qualities of peace
stated by the Blessed One in the suttas beginning with: "Bhikkhus, I shall teach
you the unformed ... the truth ... the other shore ... the hard-to-see ... the
undecaying ... the lasting ... the undiversified ... the deathless ... the auspicious
... the safe ... the marvellous ... the intact ... the unafflicted ... the purity ... the
island ... the shelter ...." (S IV 360-72).74
249.	As he recollects peace in its special qualities of disillusionment of vanity
etc., in this way then: "On that occasion his mind is not obsessed by greed or
obsessed by hate or obsessed by delusion; his mind has rectitude on that occasion,
being inspired by peace" (see VII.65, etc.). So when he has suppressed the
hindrances in the way already described under the recollection of the
Enlightened One, etc., the jhana factors arise in a single moment. But owing to
the profundity of the special qualities of peace, or owing to his being occupied
in recollecting special qualities of various kinds, the jhana is onlv access and
does not reach absorption. And that jhana itself is known as "recollection of
peace" too because it arises by means of the special qualities of peace.
250.	And as in the case of the six recollections, this also comes to success only
in a noble disciple. Still, though this is so, it can nevertheless also be brought to
mind bv an ordinary person who values peace. For even by hearsay the mind
has confidence in peace.
251.	A bhikkhu who is devoted to this recollection of peace sleeps in bliss and
wakes in bliss, his faculties are peaceful, his mind is peaceful, he has conscience
and shame, he is confident, he is resolved [to attain] the superior [state], he is
respected and honoured by his fellows in the life of purity And even if he
penetrates no higher, he is at least headed for a happy destiny
73.	Modern etymology derives the word Nibbana (Skr. nirvana) from the negative
prefix nir plus the root vd (to blow). The original literal meaning was probably
"extinction" of a fire by ceasing to blow on it with bellows (a smith's fire for example).
It seems to have been extended to extinction of fire by any means, for example, the
going out of a lamp's flame (nibbdyati—M III 245). By analogy it was extended to the
extinction of the five-aggregate process on the Arahant's death (see It 38). Nibbana is
not the "extinction of a self or of a living lasting being," such a mistaken opinion being
the annihilation view (see e.g. M 1140, S III 109).
74.	Some texts add lena (another word for shelter). Still others are given in the
Samyutta text.

To mind the noble peace, which can
Reward him in so many ways.

Chapter IX
The DiJvine Abidings
(Brahmavihara-niddesa)
[(1) Loving-Kindness]
1.	[295] The four divine abidings were mentioned next to the recollections as
meditation subjects (III. 105). They are loving-kindness, compassion, gladness
and equanimity. A meditator, who wants to develop firstly loving-kindness
among these, if he is a beginner, should sever the impediments and learn the
meditation subject. Then, when he has done the work connected with the meal
and got rid of any dizziness due to it, he should seat himself comfortably on a
well-prepared seat in a secluded place. To start with, he should review the
danger in hate and the advantage in patience.
2.	Why? Because hate has to be abandoned and patience attained in the
development of this meditation subject, and he cannot abandon unseen dangers
and attain unknown advantages.
Now, the danger in hate should be seen in accordance with such suttas as
this: "Friends, when a man hates, is a prey to hate and his mind is obsessed by
hate, he kills living things, and ..." (A I 216). And the advantage in patience
should be understood according to such suttas as these:
"No higher rule, the Buddhas say than patience,
And no Nibbana higher than forbearance" (D H 49; Dhp 184);
"Patience in force, in strong array:
'Tis him I call a brahman" (Dhp 399);
"No greater thing exists than patience" (S I 222).
3.	Thereupon he should embark upon the development of loving-kindness for
the purpose of secluding the mind from hate seen as a danger and introducing
it to patience known as an advantage.
But when he begins, he must know that some persons are of the wrong sort at
the very beginning and that loving-kindness sh|ould be developed towards
certain kinds of persons and not towards certain other kinds at first. [296]
4.	For loving-kindness should not be developed at first towards the following
four kinds of persons: an antipathetic person, a very dearlv loved friend, a neutral
person, and a hostile person. Also it should not be developed specifically (see
§49) towards the opposite sex, or towards a dead person.
`292
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
5.	What is the reason why it should not be developed at first towards an
antipathetic person and the others? To put an antipathetic person in a dear
one's place is fatiguing. To put a very dearly loved friend in a neutral person's
place is fatiguing; and if the slightest mischance befalls] the friend, he feels like
weeping. To put a neutral person in a respected one's or a dear one's place is
fatiguing. Anger springs up in him if he recollects a hostile person. That is why
it should not be developed at first towards an antipathetic person and the rest.
6.	Then, if he develops it specifically towards the opposite sex, lust inspired by
that person springs up in him. An elder supported by a family was asked, it
seems, by a friend's son, "Venerable sir, towards whom should loving-kindness
be developed?" The elder told him, "Towards a person one loves." He loved his
own wife. Through developing loving-kindness towards her he was fighting
against the wall all the night.1 That is why it should not be developed specifically
towards the opposite sex.
7.	But if he develops it towards a dead person, he reaches neither absorption
nor access. A young bhikkhu, it seems, had started developing loving-kindness
inspired by his teacher. His loving-kindness made no headway at all. He went to
a senior elder and told him, "Venerable sir, I am quite familiar with attaining
jhana through loving-kindness, and vet I cannot attain it. What is the matter?"
The elder said, "Seek the sign, friend, [the object of your meditation]." He did so.
Finding that his teacher had died, he proceeded with developing loving-kindness
inspired by another and attained absorption. That is why it should not be
developed towards one who is dead.
8.	First of all it should be developed only towards oneself, doing it repeatedly
thus: "May I be happy and free from suffering" or "May I keep myself free from
enmity, affliction and anxiety and live happily"
9.	If that is so, does it not conflict with what is said in the texts? For there is no
mention of any development of it towards oneself in what is said in the Vibhanga:
"And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart filled
with loving-kindness? Just as he would feel loving-kindness on seeing a dearly
loved person, so he pervades all beings with loving-kindness" (Vibh 272); and
in what is said in the Patisambhida: "In what five ways is the mind-deliverance
of loving-kindness [practiced] with unspecified pervasion? May all beings be
free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing things
[297] ... all who are born ... all persons ... all those who have a personality be
free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily" (Patis II 130); and in
what is said in the Metta Sutta: "In joy and safety may all beings be joyful at
heart" (Sn 145). [Does it not conflict with those texts?]
1. "'Fighting against the wall': having undertaken the precepts of virtue and sat
down on a seat in his room with the door locked, he was developing loving-kindness.
Blinded bv lust arisen under cover of the loving-kindness, he wanted to go to his wife,
and without noticing the door he beat on the wall in his desire to get out even by
breaking the wall down" (Vism-mht 286).
`293
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
10.	It does not conflict. Whv not? Because that refers to absorption. But this
[initial development towards oneself] refers to [making oneself] an example. For
even if he developed loving-kindness for a hundred or a thousand years in this
way "I am happy" and so on, absorption would never arise. But if he develops it
in this way: "I am happy Just as I want to be happy and dread pain, as I want to
live and not to die, so do other beings, too," making himself the example, then
desire for other beings' welfare and happiness arises in him. And this method is
indicated by the Blessed One's saying:
I visited all quarters with my mind
Nor found I any dearer than myself;
Self is likewise to every other dear;
Who loves himself will never harm another (S I 75; Ud 47).
11.	So he should first, as example, pervade himself with loving-kindness. Next
after that, in order to proceed easily he can recollect such gifts,2 kind words, etc.,
------- ------' —— — r --------- —— — ------“ - —-------- ---------'
as inspire love and endearment, such virtue, learning, etc., as inspire respect
and reverence met with in a teacher or his equivalent or a preceptor or his
equivalent, developing loving-kindness towards him in the way beginning, "May
this good man be happy and free from suffering." With such a person, of course,
he attains absorption.
12.	But if this bhikkhu does not rest content with just that much and wants to
break down the barriers, he should next, after that, develop loving-kindness
towards a very dearly loved friend, then towards a neutral person as a very
dearly loved friend, then towards a hostile person as neutral. And while he does
so, he should make his mind malleable and wieldy in each instance before
passing on to the next.
13.	But if he has no enemy or he is of the type of a great man who does not
perceive another as an enemy even when the other does him harm, he should
not interest himself as follows: "Now that my consciousness of loving-kindness
has become wieldy towards a neutral person, I shall apply it to a hostile one."
[298] Rather it was about one who actually has an enemy that it was said above
that he should develop loving-kindness towards a hostile person as neutral.
[Getting Rid of Resentment]
14.	If resentment arises in him when he applies his mind to a hostile person
because he remembers wrongs done by that person, he should get rid of the
resentment by entering repeatedly into loving-kindness [jhana] towards any of
the first-mentioned persons and then, after he has emerged each time, directing
loving-kindness towards that person.
15.	But if it does not die out in spite of his efforts, then:
Let him reflect upon the saw
With other figures of such kind,
2. Reading dana-piyavacanadini with Ce (see four suit gal lavatth^ui i—A II 32).
`294
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
And strive, and strive repeatedly
To leave resentment far behind.
He should admonish himself in this way: "Now, you who get angry, has not
the Blessed One said this: 'Bhikkhus, even if bandits brutally severed limb from
limb with a two-handled sa|w, he who entertained hate in his heart on that
account would not be one who carried out my teaching?"' (M I 129). And this:
"To repay angry men in kind
Is worse than to be angry first;
Repay not angry men in kind
And win a battle hard to win.
The weal of both he does promote,
His own and then the other's too,
Who shall another's anger know
And mindfully maintain his peace" (S I 162).
And this: "Bhikkhus, there are seven things gratifying and helpful to an
enemy that happen to one who is angry whether woman or man. What seven?
Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy 'Let him be ugly!' Why is
that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy's beauty Now, this angry person
is a prey to anger, ruled by anger; though well bathed, well anointed, with hair
and beard trimmed and clothed in white, yet he is ugly, being a prey to anger.
This is the first thing gratifying and helpful to an enemy that befalls one who is
angry whether woman or man. Furthermore, an enemy wishes thus for his enemy
'Let him lie in pain!' ... 'Let him have no fortune!' ... 'Let him not be wealthy!' ...
'Let him not be famous!' ... 'Let him have no friends!' [299] ... 'Let him not on the
breakup of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destiny in the heavenly
world!'3 Why is that? An enemy does not delight in an enemy's going to a
happy destiny. Now, this angry person is a prey to anger, ruled by anger; he
misconducts himself in body, speech and mind. Misconducting himself thus in
body speech and mind, on the breakup of the body after death, he reappears in
a state of loss, in an unhappy destiny in perdition, in hell, being a prey to anger"
(A IV 94).? And this: "As a log from a pyre, burnt at both ends and fouled in the
middle, serves neither for timber in the village nor for timber in the forest, so is
such a person as this I say" (A II 95, It 90)?. "If you are angry now, you will be one
who does not carry out the Blessed One's teaching; by repaying an angry man
in kind you will be worse than the angry man and not win the battle hard to win;
you will yourself do to yourself the things that help your enemy; and you will be
like a pyre log." (Source untraced)
16.	If his resentment subsides when he strives and makes effort in this way it is
good. If not, then he should remove irritation by remembering some controlled
and purified state in that person, which inspires confidence when remembered.
17.	For one person may be controlled in his bodily behaviour with his control
in doing an extensive course of duty known to all, though his verbal and mental
3. The Anguttara text has "Let him ... reappear in a state of loss" and so on.
`295
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the control
in his bodily behaviour remembered.
18.	Another may be controlled in his verbal behaviour, and his control known
to all—he may naturally be clever at welcoming kindly, easy to talk with,
congenial, open-countenanced, deferential in speech, and he may expound the
Dhamma with a sweet voice and give explanations of Dhamma with well-
rounded phrases and details—though his bodily and mental behaviour are not
controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the control in his verbal
behaviour remembered.
19.	Another may be controlled in his mental behaviour, and his control in
worshiping at shrines, etc., evident to all. For when one who is uncontrolled in
mind pays homage at a shrine or at an Enlightenment Tree or to elders, he does
not do it carefully [300] and he sits in the Dhamma-preaching pavilion with
mind astray or nodding, while one whose mind is controlled pays homage
carefully and deliberately listens to the Dhamma attentively, remembering it,
and evincing the confidence in his mind through his body or his speech. So
another may be only controlled in his mental behaviour, though his bodily and
verbal behaviour are not controlled. Then the latter should be ignored and the
control in his mental behaviour remembered.
20.	But there may be another in whom not even one of these three things is
controlled. Then compassion for that person should be aroused thus: "Though
he is going about in the human world now, nevertheless after a certain number
of days he will find himself in [one of] the eight great hells or the sixteen
prominent hells.4" For irritation subsides too through compassion. In vet another
all three may be controlled. Then he can remember any of the three in that
person, whichever he likes; for the development of loving-kindness towards
such a person is easy.
21.	And in order to make the meaning of this clear the following sutta from the
Book of Fives should be cited in full: "Bhikkhus, there are five ways of dispelling
annoyance whereby annoyance arisen in a bhikkhu can be entirely dispelled"
(A III 186-90).
22. But if irritation still arises in him in spite of his efforts, then he should
admonish himself thus:
Suppose an enemy has hurt
You now in what is his domain,
Why try yourself as well to hurt
Your mind?—That is not his domain.
In tears you left your family.
They had been kind and helpful too.
4. "The eight great hells beginning with that of Sahjlva (see J-a V 266,270). At each of
the four doors of the Great Unmitigated (Avici) Hell there are the four beginning with
the Ember (Kukula) Hell (M III 185), which make up the sixteen prominent hells"
(Vism-mht 291).
`296
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
So why not leave your enemy
The anger that brings harm to you?
This anger that vou entertain
Is gnawing at the very roots
Of all the virtues that you guard—
Who is there such a fool as you?
Another does ignoble deeds,
So you are angry—How is this?
Do you then want to copy too
The sort of acts that he commits?
Suppose another, to annoy
Provokes you with some odious act,
Whv suffer anger to spring up,
And do as he would have you do?
If vou get angry then maybe
You make him suffer, maybe not;
Though with the hurt that anger brings
You certainly are punished now
If anger-blinded enemies
Set out to tread the path of woe,
Do you by getting angry too
Intend to follow heel to toe?
If hurt is done you by a foe
Because of anger on your part,
Then put your anger down, for why
Should you be harassed groundlessly? [301]
Since states last but a moment's time
Those aggregates, by which was done
The odious act, have ceased, so now
What is it you are angry with?
Whom shall he hurt, who seeks to hurt
Another, in the other's absence?
Your presence is the cause of hurt;
Why are you angry then, with him?
23. But if resentment does not subside when he admonishes himself thus, then
he should review the fact that he himself and the other are owners of their deeds
(kamma).
Herein, he should first review this in himself thus: "Now, what is the point of
your getting angrv with him? Will [not this kamma of yours that has anger as its
source lead to yovir own harm? For you are the owner of your deeds, heir of your
deeds, having deeds as your parent, deeds as your kin, deeds as your refuge; you
will become the heir of whatever deeds you do (see A III 186). And this is not the
kind of deed to bring you to full enlightenment, to undeclared enlightenment or
`297
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
to the disciple's grade, or to any such position as the status of Brahma or Sakka,
or the throne of a Wheel-turning Monarch or a regional king, etc.; but rather this
is the kind of deed to lead to your fall from the Dispensation, even to the status of
the eaters of scraps, etc., and to the manifold suffering in the hells, and so on. Bv
doing this you are like a man who wants to hit another and picks up a burning
ember or excrement in his hand and so first burns himself or makes himself
stink."
24. Having reviewed ownership of deeds in himself in this way, he should
review it in the other also: "And what is the point of his getting angry with you?
Will it not lead to his own harm? For that venerable one is owner of his deeds,
heir of his deeds ... he will become the heir of whatever deeds he does. And this
is not the kind of deed to bring him to full enlightenment, to undeclared
enlightenment or to the disciple's grade, or to any such position as the status of
Brahma or Sakka, or to the throne of a Wheel-turning Monarch or a regional
king, etc.; but rather this is the kind of deed to lead to his fall from the Dispensation,
even to the status of the eaters of scraps, etc., and to the manifold suffering in the
hells, and so on. Bv doing this he is like a man who wants to throw dust at
another against the wind and only covers himself with it." For this is said by the
Blessed One:
"When a fool hates a man that has no hate,
Is purified and free from every blemish, [302]
Such evil he will find comes back on him,
As does fine dust thrown up against the wind" (Dhp 125).
25.	But if it still does not subside in him when he reviews ownership of deeds
in this way, then he should review the special qualities of the Master's former
conduct.
26.	Here is the wav of reviewing it: "Now you who have gone forth, is it not a
fact that when your Master was a Bodhisatta before discovering full
enlightenment, while he was still engaged in fulfilling the perfections during
the four incalculable ages and a hundred thousand aeons, he did not allow hate
to corrupt his mind even when his enemies tried to murder him on various
occasions?
27. "For example, in the Sllavant Birth Story (J-a I 261) when his friends rose to
prevent his kingdom of three hundred leagues being seized by an enemy king
who had been incited by a wicked minister in whose mind his own queen had
sown hate for him, he did not allow them to lift a weapon. Again when he was
buried, along with a thousand companions, up to the neck in a hole dug in the
earth in a charnel ground, he had no thought of hate. And when, after saving
his life by a heroic effort helped by jackals scraping away soil when they had
come to devour the corpses, he went with the aid of a spirit to his own bedroom
and saw his enemy lving on his own bed, he was not angry but treated him as a
friend, undertaking a mutual pledge, and he then exclaimed:
"The brave aspire, the wise will not lose heart;
I see myself as I had wished to be" (J-a I 267).
`298
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
28.	"And in the Khantivadin Birth Story he was asked by the stupid king of
Kasi (Benares), 'What do you preach, monk?' and he replied, 'I am a preacher of
patience'; and when the king had him flogged with scourges of thorns and had
his hands and feet cut off, he felt not the slightest anger (see J-a III 39).
29.	"It is perhaps not so wonderful that an adult who had actually gone forth
into homelessness should have acted in that way; but also as an infant he did so.
For in the Cula-Dhammapala Birth Storv his hands and feet were ordered to be
lopped off like four bamboo shoots by his father, King Mahapatapa, and his
mother lamented over him thus:
"Oh, Dhammapala's arms are severed
That had been bathed in sandalwood;
He was the heir to all the earth:
O king, my breath is choking me!" (J-a III 181). [303]
"Then his father, still not satisfied, commanded that his head be cut off as
well. But even then he had not the least trace of hate, since he had firmly resolved
thus: 'Now is the time to restrain your mind; now, good Dhammapala, be impartial
towards these four persons, that is to say towards your father who is having your
head cut off, the man who is beheading you, your lamenting mother, and yourself.'
30. "And it is perhaps not so wonderful that one who had become a hu|man
being should have acted in that way; but also as an animal he did so. For while
the Bodhisatta was the elephant called Chaddanta he was pierced in the navel
by a poisoned shaft. But even then he allowed no hate towards the hunter who
had wounded him to corrupt his mind, according as it is said:
The elephant, when struck by the stout shaft,
Addressed the hunter with no hate in mind:
What is your aim? What is the reason why
You kill me thus? What can your purpose be? (J-a V 51).
"And when the elephant had spoken thus and was told, 'Sir, I have been sent
by the king of Kasi's queen to get your tusks,' in order to fulfil her wish he cut off
his own tusks whose gorgeous radiance glittered with the flashes of the six-
coloured rays and gave them to him.
31. "And when he was the Great Monkey, the man whom he had pulled out of
a rocky chasm thought:
'Now, this is food for human kind
Like other forest animals,
So why then should a hungry man
Not kill the ape to eat? [I ask.]
I'll travel independently
Taking his meat as a provision;
Thus I shall cross the waste, and that
Will furnish my viaticum' (J-a V 71).
Then he took up a stone and dashed it on his head. But the monkey looked at
him with eyes full of tears and said:
`299
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
'Oh, act not so, good sir, or else
The fate you reap will] long deter
All others from such deeds as this
That you would do to me today' (J-a V 71).
And with no hate in his mind and regardless of his own pain he saw to it that
the man reached his journey's end in safety.
32. "And while he was the royal naga (serpent) Bhuridatta, [304] when he had
undertaken the Uposatha precepts and was lying on the top of a termite-mound,
though he was [caught and] sprinkled with medicinal charms resembling the
fire that ushers in the end of an aeon, and was put into a box and treated as a
plaything throughout the whole of Jambudipa, yet he had no trace of hate for
that brahman, according as it is said:
'While being put into the coffer
And being crushed down with his hand,
I had no hate for Alambana
Lest I should break my precept vow' (Cp 85).
33. "And when he was the royal naga Campeyya he let no hate spring up in
his mind while he was being cruelly treated by a snake charmer, according as it
is said:
"While I was living in the| Law
Observing the Uposatha
A snake charmer took me away
To play with at the royal gate.
Whatever hue he might conceive,
Blue and yellow, and red as well,
So in accordance with his thought
I would become what he had wished;
I would turn dry land into water,
And water into land likewise.
Now, had I given way to wrath
I could have seared him into ash,
Had I relaxed mind-mastery
I should have let my virtue lapse;
And one who lets his virtue lapse
Cannot attain the highest goal" (Cp 85).
34. "And when he was the royal naga Sankhapala, while he was being carried
along on a carrying pole by the sixteen village boys after they had wounded
him in eight places with sharp spears and inserted thorn creepers into the
wounds' orifices, and while, a|fter threading a strong rope through his nose,
they were causing him great agony by dragging him along bumping his body
on the surface of the ground, though he was capable of turning those village
boys to cinders with a mere glance, vet he did not even show the least trace of
hate on opening his eyes, according as it is said:
`300
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
'On the fourteenth and the fifteenth too, Alara,
I regularly kept the Holy Day,
Until there came those sixteen village boys
Bearing a rope and a stout spear as well.
The hunters cleft my nose, and through the slit
They passed a rope and dragged me off like that.
But though I felt such poignant agony
I let no hate disturb my Holy Day" (J-a V 172). [305]
35. "And he performed not onlv these wonders but also many others too such
as those told in the Matuposaka Birth Story (J-a IV 90). Now, it is in the highest
degree improper and unbecoming to you to arouse thoughts of resentment,
since you are emulating as your Master that Blessed One who reached
omniscience and who has in the special quality of patience no equal in the
world with its deities."
36. But if, as he reviews the special qualities of the Master's former conduct,
the resentment still does not subside in him, since he has long been used to the
slavery of defilement, then he should review the suttas that deal with the
beginninglessness [of the round of rebirths]. Here is what is said: "Bhikkhus, it
is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother ... your father
... your brother ... vour sister ... your son ... your daughter" (S II 189-90).
Consequently he should think about that person thus: "This person, it seems, as
my mother in the past carried me in her womb for ten months and removed from
me without disgust, as if it were vejllow sandalwood, my urine, excrement, spittle,
snot, etc., and played with me in her lap, and nourished me, carrying me about
on her hip. And this person as my father went by goat paths and paths set on
piles,5 etc., to pursue the trade of merchant, and he risked his life for me by going
into battle in double array bv sailing on the great ocean in ships and doing other
difficult things, and he nourished me by bringing back wealth bv one means or
another thinking to feed his children. And as my brother, sister, son, daughter,
this person gave me such and such help. So it is unbecoming for me to harbour
hate for him in my mind."
37. But if he is still unable to quench that thought in this way, then he should
review the advantages of loving-kindness thus: "Now, you who have gone forth
into homelessness, has it not been said by the Blessed One as follows: 'Bhikkhus,
when the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is cultivated, developed, much
practiced, made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated,
and properly undertaken, eleven blessings can be expected. What are the eleven?
A man sleeps in comfort, wakes in comfort, and dreams no evil dreams, he is
dear to human beings, he is dear to non-human beings, deities guard him, fire
and poison and weapons do not affect him, his mind is easily concentrated, the
expression of his face is serene, he dies unconfused, if he penetrates no higher

Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
he will be reborn in the Brahma-world' (A V 342). [306] If von do not stop this
thought, you will be denied these advantages."
38. But if he is still unable to stop it in this way, he should try resolution into
elements. How? "Now, you who have gone forth into homelessness, when you
are angrv with him, what is it you are angry with? Is it head hairs you are angry
with? Or body hairs? Or nails? ... Or is it urine you are angry with? Or
alternatively is it the earth element in the head hairs, etc., vou are angrv with? Or
the water element? Or the fire element? Or is it the air element you are angry
with? Or among the five aggregates or the twelve bases or the eighteen elements
with respect to which this venerable one is called by such and such a name,
which then, is it the materiality aggregate you are angry with? Or the feeling
aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, the consciousness
aggregate you are angrv with? Or is it the eye base you are angry with? Or the
visible-object base you are angry with? ... Or the mind base you are angry with?
Or the mental-object base you are angry with? Or is it the eye element you are
angry with? Or the visible-object element? Or the eye-consciousness element? ...
Or the mind element? Or the mental-object element? Or the mind-consciousness
element you are angry with?" For when he tries the resolution into elements, his
anger finds no foothold, like a mustard seed on the point of an awl or a painting
on the air.
39. But if he cannot effect the resolution into elements, he should try the giving
of a gift. It can either be given by himself to the other or accepted by himself from
the other. But if the other's livelihood is not purified and his requisites are not
proper to be used, it should be given by oneself. And in the one who does this the
annoyance with that person entirely subsides. And in the other even anger that
has been dogging him from a past birth subsides at the moment, as happened to
the senior elder who received a bowl given to him at the Cittalapabbata
Monastery by an almsfood-eater elder who had been three times made to move
from his lodging by him, and who presented it with these words: "Venerable sir,
this bowl worth eight ducats was given me by my mother who is a lay devotee,
and it is rightly obtained; let the good lay devotee acquire merit." So efficacious
is this act of giving. And this is said:
A gift for taming the untamed,
A gift for every kind of good;
Through giving gifts they do unbend
And condescend to kindly speech. [307]
[The Breaking Down of the Barriers—The Sign]
40. When his resentment towards that hostile person has been thus allayed,
then he can turn his mind with loving-kindness towards that person too, just as
towards the one who is dear, the very dear friend, and the neutral person. Then
he should break down the barriers by practicing loving-kindness over and over
again, accomplishing mental impartiality towards the four persons, that is to
say, himself, the dear person, the neutral person and the hostile person.
`302
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
41. The characteristic of it is this. Suppose this person is sitting in a place with
a dear, a neutral, and a hostile person, himself being the fourth; then bandits
come to him and say "Venerable sir, give us a bhikkhu," and on being asked
why, they answer, "So that we may kill him and use the blood of his throat as an
offering;" then if that bhikkhu thinks, "Let them take this one, or this one," he
has not broken down the barriers. And also if he thinks, "Let them take me but
not these three," he has not broken down the barriers either. Whv? Because he
seeks the harm of him whom he wishes to be taken and seeks the welfare of the
other only. But it is when he does not see a single one among the four people to
be given to the bandits and he directs his mind impartially towards himself and
towards those three people that he has broken down the barriers. Hence the
Ancients said:
42.
When he discriminates between
The four, that is himself, the dear,
The neutral, and the hostile one,
Then "skilled" is not the name he gets,
Nor "having amity at will,"
But only "kindly towards beings."
Now, when a bhikkhu's barriers
Have all the four been broken down,
He treats with equal amity
The whole world with its deities;
Far more distinguished than the first
Is he who knows no barriers.
43. Thus the sign and access are obtained by this bhikkhu simultaneously
with the breaking down of the barriers. But when breaking down of the barriers
has been effected, he reaches absorption in the way described under the earth
kasina without trouble by cultivating, developing, and repeatedly practicing
that same sign.
At this point he has attained the first jhana, which abandons five factors,
possesses five factors, is good in three ways, is endowed with ten characteristics,
I	r CT7
and is accompanied by loving-kindness. And when that has been obtained,
then by cultivating, developing, and repeatedly practicing that same sign, he
successively reaches the second and third jhanas in the fourfold system, and the
second, third and fourth in the fivefold system. [308]
[Texts and Commentary]
44. Now, it is by means of one of these jhanas beginning with the first that he
"Dwells pervading (intent upon) one direction with his heart endued with loving-
kindness, likewise the second direction, likewise the third direction, likewise
the fourth direction, and so above, below, and around; everywhere and equally
he dwells pervading the entire world with his heart endued with loving-
kindness, abundant, exalted, measureless, free from enmity, and free from
affliction" (Vibh 272; D I 250). For this versatility comes about only in one whose
consciousness has reached absorption in the first jhana and the rest.
`303
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
45.	And here endued with loving-kindness means possessing loving-kindness.
With his heart (cetasd): with his mind (cittern). One direction: this refers to anyone
direction in which a being is first discerned and means pervasion of the beings
included in that one direction. Pervading: touching, making his object. He dwells
(viharati): he causes the occurrence of an abiding (vihdra—dwelling or
continuation) in postures that is devoted to the divine abidings (see IV103).
Likewise the second: just as he dwells pervading anyone direction among those
beginning with the eastern one, so he does with the next one, and the third and
the fourth, is the meaning.
46.	So above: in that same way in t|he upper direction is what is meant. Below,
around: so too the lower direction and the direction all round. Herein, below is
underneath, and around is in the intermediate directions. So he sends his heart
full of loving-kindness back and forth in all directions like a horse in a circus
ground. Up to this point specified pervasion with loving-kindness is shown in
the discernment of each direction separately.
47.	Everywhere, etc., is said for the purpose of showing unspecified pervasion.
Herein, everywhere means in all places. Equally (sabbattataya): to all classed as
inferior, medium, superior, friendly hostile, neutral, etc., just as to oneself (attatd);
equality with oneself (atta-samatd) without making the distinction, "This is
another being," is what is meant. Or alternatively, equally (sabbattataya) is with
the whole state of the mind; not reserving even a little, is what is meant. [309]
Entire (sabbdvant): possessing all beings (sabbasattavant); associated with all
beings, is the meaning. World is the world of beings.
48.	Endued with loving-kindness is said again here in order to introduce the
synonyms beginning with abundant. Or alternatively endued with loving-kindness
is repeated because the word likewise or the word so is not repeated here as it was
in the case of the [preceding] specified pervasion. Or alternatively it is said as a
way of concluding. And abundant should be regarded here as abundance in
pervading. But it is exalted in plane [from the sensual-sphere plane to the fine-
material-sphere plane], measureless through familiarity and through having
measureless beings as its object, free from enmity through abandonment of ill
will and hostility, and free from affliction through abandonment of grief; without
suffering, is what is meant. This is the meaning of the versatility described in the
way beginning, "With his heart endued with loving-kindness."
49.	And just as this versatility is successful only in one whose mind has reached
absorption, so too that described in the Patisambhida should be understood to
be successful only in one whose mind has reached absorption, that is to say:
"The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is [practiced] with unspecified
pervasion in five ways. The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is [practiced]
with specified pervasion in seven ways. The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness
is [practiced] with directional pervasion in ten ways" (Patis II 130).
50.	And herein, the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is [practiced] with
unspecified pervasion in these five ways: "May all beings be free from enmity
affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing things ... all creatures
`304
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
... all persons ... all those who have a personality be free from enmity affliction
and anxiety and live happily" (Patis II 130).
51.	The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is [practiced] with specified
pervasion in these seven wavs: "May all women be free from enmity affliction
and anxiety and live happily May all men ... all Noble Ones ... all not Noble
Ones ... all deities ... all human beings ... all in states of loss be free from enmity
affliction and anxiety and live happily" (Patis II 131).
52.	The mind-deliverance of loving-kindness is [practiced] with directional
pervasion in these ten ways: "May all beings in the eastern direction be free
from enmity affliction and anxiety, and live happily. May all beings in the western
direction ... northern direction ... southern direction [310] ... eastern intermediate
direction ... western intermediate direction ... northern intermediate direction
... southern intermediate direction ... downward direction ... upward direction
be free from enmity affliction and anxiety and live happily May all breathing
things in the eastern direction ... Mav all creatures in the eastern direction ...
May all persons in the eastern direction ... May all who have a personality in
the eastern direction ... [etc.] ... in the upward direction be free from enmity
affliction and anxiety and live happily. May all women in the eastern direction
... Mav all men in the eastern direction ... May all Noble Ones in the eastern
direction ... May all not Noble Ones in the eastern direction ... May all deities in
the eastern direction ... May all] human beings in the eastern direction ... May
all those in states of loss in the eastern direction ... [etc.] ... be free from enmity
affliction and anxiety and live happily" (Patis II 131).
53. Herein, all signifies inclusion without exception. Beings (satta): they are
held (satta), gripped (visatta) bv desire and greed for the aggregates beginning
with materiality thus they are beings (satta). For this is said by the Blessed One:
"Any desire for matter, Radha, any greed for it, any delight in it, any craving for
it, has held (satta) it, has gripped (visatta) it, that is why 'a being' (satta) is said"
(S III 190). But in ordinary speech this term of common usage is applied also to
those who are without greed, just as the term of common usage "palm fan"
(tdlavanta) is used for different sorts of fans [in general] even if made of split
bamboo. However, [in the world] etymologists (akkhara-cintaka) who do not
consider meaning have it that it is a mere name, while those who do consider
meaning have it that a "being" (satta) is so called with reference to the "bright
principle" (satta).6
54. Breathing things (pdna): so called because ot their state of breathing (pananatd);
the meaning is, because their existence depends on in-breaths and out-breaths.
Creatures (bhuta): so called because of being (bhutatta = becomeness); the meaning
is, because of their being fully become (sambhutatta), because of their being
generated (abhinibbattatta). Persons (puggala): "pum" is what hell is called; they
fall (galanti) into that, is the meaning. Personality (attabhdva) is what the physical
6. Satta—"the bright principle": Skr. sattva; one of the three principles in the Sarikhya
system, the other two being rajas (Pali: rajo) or turbulence and tamas (Pali: tamo) or
darkness. Not in PED.
`305
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
body is called; or it is just the pentad of aggregates, since it is actually onlv a
concept derived from that pentad of aggregates7 [What is referred to is] included
(pariydpanna) in that personality, thus it "has a personality" (attabhdva-
pariydpanna). "Included in" is delimited by; "gone into" is the meaning.
55.	And all the remaining [terms] should be understood as synonyms for "all
beings" used in accordance with ordinary speech as in the case of the term
"beings." Of course, [311] there are other synonyms too for all "beings," such as
all "folks," all "souls," etc.; still it is for clarity's sake that "The mind-deliverance
of loving-kindness is [practiced] with unspecified pervasion in five ways" is
said and that only these five are mentioned.
56.	Those who would have it that there is not only a mere verbal difference
between "beings," "breathing things," etc., but also an actual difference in
meaning, are contradicted by the mention of unspecified pervasion. So instead
of taking the meaning in that way, the unspecified pervasion with loving-
kindness is done in any one of these five ways.
And here, may all beings be free from enmity is one absorption; free from affliction
is one absorption—free from affliction (abydbajjlui) is free from afflictedness
(ibyabadha-rahita);8 free from anxiety is one absorption—free from anxiety is free
from suffering; may they live happily is one absorption. Consequently he should
do his pervading with loving-kindness according to whichever of these phrases
is clear to him. So with the four kinds of absorption in each of the five ways, there
are twenty kinds of absorption in unspecified pervasion.
57.	In specified pervasion, with the four kinds of absorption in each of the
seven ways, there are twentv-eight kinds of absorption. And here "woman" and
"man" are stated according to sex; "Noble Ones" and "not Noble Ones"
according to Noble Ones and [ordinary people; "deities" and "human beings"
and "those in states of loss" according to the kind of rebirth.
58.	In directional pervasion, with twenty kinds of absorption in each of the
directions beginning with "all beings in the eastern direction," there are two
hundred kinds of absorption; and with twenty-eight kinds in each of the
directions beginning with "all women in the eastern direction" there are two
hundred and eighty kinds; so these make four hundred and eighty kinds of
absorption. Consequently all the kinds of absorption mentioned in the
Patisambhida amount to five hundred and twenty-eight.
7.	"Here when the aggregates are not fully understood, there is naming (abhidliana)
of them and of the consciousness of them as self (atta), that is to say, the physical body
or alternatively the five aggregates. 'Derived from': apprehending, gripping, making a
support. 'Since it is actually a mere concept': because of presence (sabbhavato) as a
mere concept in what is called a being, though in the highest sense the 'being' is non-
existent" (Vism-mht 298). See also Ch. Vlll, note 11.
8.	Harvard text reads byapadarahita, which would be renderable as "free from ill
will." Vism-mht (p. 299) supports a reading bydbadha, which seems better.
`306
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
59.	So when this meditator develops the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness
through anv one of these kinds of absorption, he obtains the eleven advantages
described in the way beginning, "A man sleeps in comfort" (§37).
60.	Herein, sleeps in comfort means that instead of sleeping uncomfortably
turning over and snoring as other people do, he sleeps comfortably, he falls
asleep as though entering upon an attainment.
61.	He wakes in comfort: instead of waking uncomfortably, groaning and
yawning and turning over as others do, he wakes comfortably without contortions,
like a lotus opening. [312]
62.	He dreams no evil dreams: when he sees dreams, he sees only auspicious
ones, as though he were worshipping a shrine, as though he were making an
offering, as though he were hearing the Dhamma. But he does not see evil
dreams as others do, as though being surrounded by bandits, as though being
threatened by wild beasts, as though falling into chasms (see XIV n. 45).
63.	He is dear to human beings: he is as dear to and beloved by human beings as
a necklace worn to hang on the chest, as a wreath adorning the head.
64.	He is dear to non-human beings: he is just as dear to non-human beings as he
is to human beings, as in the Elder Visakha's case. He was a landowner, it
seems, at Pataliputta (Patna). While he was living there he heard this: "The
Island of Tambapanni (Sri Lanka), apparently is adorned with a diadem of
shrines and gleams with the yellow cloth, and there a man can sit or lie wherever
he likes; there the climate is favourable, the abodes are favourable, the people are
favourable, the Dhamma to be heard is favourable, and all these favourable things
are easily obtained there."
65.	He made over his fortune to his wife and children and left his home with
only a single ducat (kahdpana) sewn into the hem of his garment. He stopped for
one month on the sea coast in expectation of a ship, and meanwhile by his skill
in trading he made a thousand during the month by buying goods here and
selling them there in lawful enterprise.
66.	Eventually he came to the Great Monastery [(Mahavihara) at Anuradha-
pura], and there he asked for the going forth into homelessness. When he was
being conducted to the chapter house (sTmd) for the going-forth ceremony, the
purse containing the thousand pieces dropped out from under his belt. When
asked "What is that?" he replied, "It is a thousand ducats, venerable sirs." They
told him, "Lav follower, it is not possible to distribute them after the going forth.
Distribute them now." Then he said, "Let none who have come to the scene of
Visakha's going forth depart empty-handed," and opening [the purse] he
strewed them over the chapter house yard, after which he received the going
forth and the full admission.
67. When he had acquired five vears' seniority and had become familiar with
the two Codes (Patimokkha; see 111.31) he celebrated the Pavdrand at the end of
the Rains, took a meditation subject that suited him, and set out to wander, living
for four months in each monastery and doing the duties on a basis of equality
with the residents. While he was wandering in this way:
`307
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
The elder halted in a wood
To scan the tenor of his way;
He thundered forth this roundelay
Proclaiming that he found it good:
So from your full-admission day
Till in this place you paused and stood
No stumbling mars your bhikkhuhood;
Be thankful for such grace, I say. [313]
68.	On his way to Cittalapabbata he came to a road fork and stood wondering
which turn to take. Then a deity living in a rock held out a hand pointing out the
road to him.
69.	He came to the Cittalapabbata Monastery After he had stayed there for
four months he lay down thinking, "In the morning I depart." Then a deity
living in a manila tree at the end of the walk sat down on a step of the stair and
burst into tears. The elder asked, "Who is that?"—"It is I, Maniliva, venerable
sir."—"What are you weeping for?"—"Because you are going away."—"What
good does my living here to you?"—"Venerable sir, as long as you live here non-
human beings treat each other kindly Now, when you are gone, they will start
quarrels and loose talk."9 The elder said, "If my living here makes you live at
peace, that is good," and so he stayed there another four months. Then he again
thought of leaving, but the deity wept as before. And so the elder lived on there,
and it was there that he attained Nibbana.
This is how a bhikkhu who abides in loving-kindness is dear to non-human
beings.
70.	Deities guard him: deities guard him as a mother and father guard their
child.
71.	Fire; poison and weapons do not affect him: they do not affect, do not enter into,
the body of one who abides in loving-kindness, like the fire in the case of the lay
woman devotee Uttara (see XII.34 and Dlip-a III 310), like the poison in the case
of the Samyutta reciter the Elder Ctila-Siva, like the knife in the case of the novice
Sahkicca (see Dhp-a II 249); they do not disturb the body is what is meant.
77	TV *■“' ”il"1 ^ XX^ VtXL..
72.	And thev tell the story of the cow here too. A cow was giving milk to her
calf, it seems. A hunter, thinking "I shall shoot her," flourished a long-handled
spear in his hand and flung it. It struck her body and bounced off like a palm
leaf—and that was owing neither to access nor to absorption, but simply to the
strength of her consciousness of love for her calf. So mightily powerful is loving-
kindness.
73.	His mind is easily concentrated: the mind of one who abides in loving-kindness
is quickly concentrated, there is no sluggishness about it. [314]
74.	The expression of his face is serene: his face has a serene expression, like a
palmyra fruit loosed fijom its stem.
9. For dutthulla see Ch. IV note 36. Here the meaning is more likely to be "bad" or
"lewd" than "inert."
`308
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
75.	He dies unconfused: there is no dying deluded for one who abides in loving-
kindness. He passes away undeluded as if falling asleep.
76.	If he penetrates no higher: if he is unable to reach higher than the attainment
of loving-kindness and attain Arahantship, |then when he falls from this life, he
reappears in the Brahma-world as one who wakes up from sleep.
This is the detailed explanation of the development of loving-kindness.
[(2) Compassion]
77.	One who wants to develop compassion should begin his task by reviewing
the danger in lack of compassion and the advantage in compassion.
And when he begins it, he should not direct it at first towards the dear, etc.,
persons; for one who is dear simply retains the position of one who is dear, a
verv dear companion retains the position of a very dear companion, one who is
neutral retains the position of one who is neutral, one who is antipathetic retains
the position of one who is antipathetic, and one who is hostile retains the position
of one who is hostile. One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not
the field for it.
78.	In the Vibhanga it is said: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one
direction with his heart endued with compassion? Just as he would feel
compassion on seeing an unlucky, unfortunate person, so he pervades all beings
with compassion" (Vibh 273). Therefore first of all, on seeing a wretched man,
unlucky unfortunate, in every wav a fit object for compassion, unsightly reduced
to utter misery with hands and feet cut off, sitting in the shelter for the helpless
with a pot placed before him, with a mass of maggots oozing from his arms and
legs, and moaning, compassion should be felt for him in this wav: "This being
has indeed b|een reduced to misery; if only he could be freed from this suffering!"
But if he does not encounter such a person, then he can arouse compassion
for an evil-doing person, even though he is happy by comparing him to one
about to be executed. How?
79.	Suppose a robber has been caught with stolen goods, and in accordance
with the king's command to execute him, the king's men bind him and lead him
off to the place of execution, giving him a hundred blows in sets of four. Then
people give him things to chew and eat and also garlands and perfumes,
unguents and betel leaves. Although [315] he goes along eating and enjoving
these things as though he were happy and well off, still no one fancies that he is
really happy and well off. On the contrary people feel compassion for him,
thinking, "This poor wretch is now about to die; every step he takes brings him
nearer to the presence of death." So too a bhikkhu whose meditation subject is
compassion should arouse compassion for an [evil-doing] person even if he is
happy: "Though this poor wretch is now happy cheerful, enjoying his wealth,
still for want of even one good deed done now in anv one of the three doors [of
body speech and mind] he can come to experience untold suffering in the states
of loss."
`309
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
80.	Having aroused compassion for that person in that way, he should next
arouse compassion for a dear person, next for a neutral person, and next for a
hostile person, successively in the same way.
81.	But if resentment towards the hostile person arises in the way already
described, he should make it subside in the way described under loving-kindness
(§§14-39).
And here too when someone has done profitable deeds and the meditator
sees or hears that he has been overtaken by one of the kinds of ruin beginning
with ruin of health, relatives, property, etc., he deserves the meditator's
compassion; and so he does too in anv case, even with no such ruin, thus "In
reality he is unhappy" because he is not exempt from the suffering of the round
[of becoming]. And in the way already described the meditator should break
down the barriers between the four kinds of people, that is to say himself, the
dear person, the neutral person and the hostile person. Then cultivating that
sign, developing it and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the
absorption by the triple and quadruple jhana in the way already stated under
loving-kindness.
82.	But the order given in the Anguttara Commentary is that a hostile person
should first be made the object of compassion, and when the mind has been
made malleable with respect to him, next the unlucky person, next the dear
person, and next oneself. That does not agree with the text, "an unlucky
unfortunate person" (§78).Therefore he should begin the development, break
down the barriers, and increase absorption only in the way stated here.
83.	After that, the versatility consisting in the unspecified pervasion in five
ways, the specified pervasion in seven ways, and the directional pervasion in ten
ways, and the advantages described as "He sleeps in comfort," etc., should be
understood in the same way as given under loving-kindness.
This is the detailed explanation of the development of compassion. [316]
[(3) Gladness]
84.	One who begins the development of gladness10 should not start with the
dear person and the rest; for a dear person is not the proximate cause of gladness
merely in virtue of dearness, how much less the neutral and the hostile person.
One of the opposite sex and one who is dead are also not the field for it.
85. However, the very dear companion can be the proximate cause for it—one
who in the commentaries is called a "boon companion," for he is constantly
glad: he laughs first and speaks afterwards. So he should be the first to be
pervaded with gladness. Or on seeing or hearing about a dear person being
happy cheerful and glad, gladness can be aroused thus: "This being is indeed
glad. How good, how excellent!" For this is what is referred to in the Vibhanga:
"And how does a bhikkhu dwell pervading one direction with his heart endued
10. Mudita—"gladness" as one of the divine abidings is always in the sense of
gladness at others' success. Sometimes rendered as "altruistic joy" and "sympathetic
gladness."
`310
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
with gladness? Just as he would be glad on seeing a dear and beloved person, so
he pervades all beings with gladness" (Vibh 274).
86.	But if his boon companion or the dear person was happy in the past but is
now unlucky and unfortunate, then gladness can still be aroused by
remembering his past happiness and apprehending the glad aspect in this
way: "In the past he had great wealth, a great following and he was always
glad." Or gladness can be aroused by apprehending the future glad aspect in
him in this way: "In the future he will again enjoy similar success and will go
about in gold palanquins, on the backs of elephants or on horseback, and so
on."
Having thus aroused gladness with respect to a dear person, he can then
direct it successively towards a neutral one, and after that towards a hostile one.
87.	But if resentment towards the hostile one arises in him in the way already
described, he should make it subside in the same way as described under loving-
kindness (§§14-39).
He should break down the barriers bv means of mental impartiality towards
the four, that is, towards these three and himself. And by cultivating that sign,
developing and repeatedly practicing it, he should increase the absorption to
triple and quadruple jhana in the way already stated under loving-kindness.
Next, the versatility consisting in unspecified pervasion in five ways, specified
pervasion in seven ways, and directional pervasion in ten ways, and also the
advantages described as "He sleeps in comfort," etc., should be understood in
the same way as stated under loving-kindness.
This is the detailed explanation ot the development of gladness.
[317]
[(4) Equanimity]
88. One who wants to develop equanimity must have already obtained the
triple or quadruple jhana in loving-kindness, and so on. He should emerge from
the third jhana [in the fourfold reckoning], after he has made it familiar, and he
should see danger in the former [three divine abidings] because they are linked
with attention given to beings' enjoyment in the way beginning "May they be
happy" because resentment and approval are near, and because their association
with joy is gross. And he should also see the advantage in equanimity because
it is peaceful. Then he should arouse equanimity (upekkha) by looking on with
equanimity (ajjhupekkhitvd) at a person who is normally neutral; after that at a
dear person, and the rest. For this is said: "And how does a bhikkhu dwell
pervading one direction with his heart endued with equanimity? Just as he
would feel equanimity on seeing a person who was neither beloved nor unloved,
so he pervades all beings with equanimity" (Vibh 275).
89. Therefore he shouljd arouse equanimity towards the neutral person in the
way already stated. Then, through the neutral one, he should break down the
barriers in each case between the three people, that is, the dear person, then the
`311
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
boon companion, and then the hostile one, and lastly himself. And he should
cultivate that sign, develop and repeatedly practice it.
90. As he does so the fourth jhana arises in him in the way described under the
earth kasina.
But how then? Does this arise in [one in whom the third jhana has already
arisen on the basis of the earth kasina, etc.? It does not. Why not? Because of the
dissimilarity of the object. It arises only in one in whom the third jhana has
arisen on the basis of loving-kindness, etc., because the object is similar.
But after that the versatility and the obtaining of advantages should be
understood in the same way as described under loving-kindness.
This is the detailed explanation ot the development of equanimity.
[General]
91.	Now, having thus known these divine abidings
Told by the Divine One (brahma) supremely [wise],
There is this general explanation too
Concerning them that he should recognize.
[Meanings]
92.	Now, as to the meaning firstly of loving-kindness, compassion, gladness
and equanimity: it fattens (:mejjati), thus it is loving-kindness (metta); it is solvent
(siniyhati) is the meaning. Also: it comes about with respect to a friend (mitta),
[318] or it is behaviour towards a friend, thus it is loving-kindness (metta).
When there is suffering in others it causes (karoti) good people's hearts to be
moved (kampana), thus it is compassion (karund). Or alternatively it combats
(kindti)11 others' suffering, attacks and demolishes it, thus it is compassion. Or
alternatively it is scattered (kiriyati) upon those who suffer, it is extended to them
by pervasion, thus it is compassion (karund).
Those endowed with it are glad (modanti), or itself is glad (modati), or it is the
mere act of being glad (modana), thus it is gladness (miidita).
It looks on at (upekkhati), abandoning such interestedness as thinking "May
they be free from enmity" and having recourse to neutrality thus it is equanimity
(upekkhd).
[Characteristic, Etc.]
93. As to the characteristic, etc., loving-kindness is characterized here as
promoting the aspect of welfare. Its function is to prefer welfare. It is manifested
as the removal of annoyance. Its proximate cause is seeing loveableness in beings.
It succeeds when it makes ill will subside, and it fails when it produces (selfish)
affection.

ordinary meaning "to buy" which is wrong.
`312
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
94.	Compassion is characterized as promoting the aspect of allaying suffering.
Its function resides in not bearing others' suffering. It is manifested as non-
cruelty. Its proximate cause is to see helplessness in those overwhelmed by
suffering. It succeeds when it makes cruelty subside and it fails when it produces
sorrow.
95.	Gladness is characterized as gladdening (produced by others' success).12
Its function resides in being unenvious. It is manifested as the elimination of
aversion (boredom). Its proximate cause is seeing beings, success. It succeeds
when it makes aversion (boredom) subside, and it fails when it produces
merriment.
96.	Equanimity is characterized as promoting the aspect of neutrality towards
beings. Its function is to see equality in beings. It is manifested as the quieting of
resentment and approval. Its proximate cause is seeing ownership of deeds
(kamma) thus: "Beings are owners of their deeds. Whose13 [if not theirs] is the
choice by which they will become happy or will get free from suffering, or will
not fall away from the success they have reached?" It succeeds when it makes
resentment and approval subside, and it fails when it produces the equanimity
of unknowing, which is that [worldly-minded indifference of ignorance] based
on the house life.
[Purpose]
97. The general purpose of tjhese four divine abidings is the bliss of insight
and an excellent [form of future] existence. That peculiar to each is respectively
the warding off of ill will, and so on. For here loving-kindness has the purpose
of warding off ill will, while the others have the respective purposes of warding
off cruelty, aversion (boredom), and greed or resentment. And this is said too:
"For this is the escape from ill will, friends, that is to say, the mind-deliverance of
loving-kindness ... For this is the escape from cruelty friends, that is to say the
mind-deliverance of compassion ... For this is the escape from boredom, friends,
that is to say the mind-deliverance of gladness ... For this is the escape from
greed, friends, that is to say the mind-deliverance of equanimity" (D III 248).
[The Near and Far Enemies]
98. And here each one has two enemies, one near and one far.
The divine abiding of loving-kindness [319] has greed as its near enemy,14
since both share in seeing virtues. Greed behaves like a foe who keeps close by a
man, and it easily finds an opportunity. So loving-kindness should be well

13.	All texts read kassa (whose), which is confirmed in the quotation translated in
note 20. It is tempting, in view of the context, to read kannnassa (kamma's), but there
is no authority for it. The statement would then be an assertion instead of a question.
14.	"Greed is the near enemy of loving-kindness since it is able to corrupt owing to
its similarity like an enemy masquerading as a friend" (Vism-mht 309).
`313
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
protected from it. And ill will, which is dissimilar to the similar greed, is its far
enemy like a foe ensconced in a rock wilderness. So loving-kindness must be
practiced free from fear of that; for it is not possible to practice loving-kindness
and feel anger simultaneously (see D III 247-48).
99. Compassion has grief based on the home life as its near enemy since both
share in seeing failure. Such grief has been described in the way beginning,
"When a man either regards as a privation failure to obtain visible objects
cognizable bv the eye that are sought after, desired, agreeable, gratifying and
associated with worldliness, or when he recalls those formerly obtained that are
past, ceased and changed, then grief arises in him. Such grief as this is called
grief based on the home life" (M III 218). And cruelty which is dissimilar to the
similar grief, is its far enemy So compassion must be practiced free from fear of
that; for it is not possible to practice compassion and be cruel to breathing things
simultaneously.
100.	Gladness has joy based on the home life as its near enemy since both share
in seeing success. Such joy has been described in the way beginning, "When a
man either regards as gain the obtaining of visible objects cognizable by the eye
that are sought ... and associated with worldliness, or recalls those formerly
obtained that are past, ceased, and changed, then jov arises in him. Such joy as
this is called joy based on the home life" (M III 217). And aversion (boredom),
which is dissimilar to the similar joy is its far enemy So gladness should be
practiced free from fear of that; for it is not possible to practice gladness and be
discontented with remote abodes and things connected with the higher
profitableness simultaneously.
101.	Equanimity has the equanimity of unknowing based on the home life as
its near enemy since both share in ignoring faults and virtues. Such unknowing
has been described in the way beginning, "On seeing a visible object with the
eye equanimity arises in the foolish infatuated ordinary man, in the untaught
ordinary man who has not conquered his limitations, who has not conquered
future [kamma] result, who is unperceiving of danger. Such equanimity as this
does not surmount the visible object. Such equanimity as this is called equanimity
based on the home life" (M III 219). And greed and resentment, which are
dissimilar to the similar unknowing, are its far enemies. Therefore equanimity
must be practiced free from fear of that; [320] for it is not possible to look on with
equanimity and be inflamed with greed or be resentful15 simultaneously
[The Beginning, Middle and End, Etc.]
102. Now, zeal consisting in desire to act is the beginning of all these things.
Suppression of the hindrances, etc., is the middle. Absorption is the end. Their

to "resentment" (patigha), as the verb, "to be inflamed with greed" (rajjati) corresponds
with "greed" (raga).
`314

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
object is a single living being or many living beings, as a mental object consisting
in a concept.
[The Order in Extension]
103. The extension of the object takes place either in access or in absorption.
Here is the order of it. Just as a skilled ploughman first delimits an area and then
does his ploughing, so first a single dwelling should be delimited and loving-
kindness developed towards all beings there in the way beginning, "In this
dwelling may all beings be free from enmity" When his mind has become
malleable and wieldy with respect to that, he can then delimit two dwellings.
Next he can successively delimit three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, one
street, half the village, the whole village, the district, the kingdom, one direction,
and so on up to one world-sphere, or even beyond that, and develop loving-
kindness towards the beings in such areas. Likewise with compassion and so
......... o
on. This is the order in extending here.
[The Outcome]
104.	Just as the immaterial states are the outcome ot the kasinas, and the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception is the outcome of
concentration, and fruition attainment is the outcome of insight, and the
attainment of cessation is the outcome of serenity coupled with insight, so the
divine abiding of equanimity is the outcome of the first three divine abidings.
For just as the gable rafters cannot be placed in the air without having first set
up the scaffolding and built the framework of beams, so it is not possible to
develop the fourth (jhana in the fourth divine abiding) without having already
developed the third jhana in the earlier (three divine abidings).
[Four Questions]
105.	And here it may be asked: But why are loving-kindness, compassion,
gladness, and equanimity called divine abidings? And why are thev only four?
And what is their order? And why are they called measureless states in the
Abhidhamma?
106.	It may be replied: The divineness of the abiding (brahmavihdratd) should be
understood here in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate. For these
abidings are the best in being the right attitude towards beings. And just as Brahma
gods abide with immaculate minds, so the meditators who associate themselves
with these abidings abide on an equal footing with Brahma gods. So they are called
divine abidings in the sense of best and in the sense of immaculate. [321]
107.	Here are the answers to the questions beginning with "Why are they only
four?":
Their number four is due to paths to purity
And other sets of four; their order to their aim
As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be
Immeasurable, so "measureless states" their name.
`315
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
108.	For among these, loving-kindness is the way to purity for one who has
much ill will, compassion is that for one who has much cruelty gladness is that
for one who has much aversion (boredom), and equanimity is that for one who
has much greed. Also attention given to beings is only fourfold, that is to say, as
bringing welfare, as removing suffering, as being glad at their success, and as
unconcern, [that is to say impartial neutrality]. And one abiding in the
measureless states should practice loving-kindness and the rest like a mother
with four sons, namely, a child, an invalid, one in the flush of youth, and one
busy with his own affairs; for she wants the child to grow up, wants the invalid
to get well, wants the one in the flush of youth to enjoy for long the benefits of
youth, and is not at all bothered about the one who is busy with his own affairs.
That is why the measureless states are onlv four as "due to paths to purity and
other sets of four."
109.	One who wants to develop these four should practice them towards beings
first as the promotion of the aspect of welfare—and loving-kindness has the
promotion of the aspect of welfare as its characteristic; and next, on seeing or
hearing or judging16 that beings whose welfare has been thus wished for are at
the mercy of suffering, they should be practiced as the promotion of the aspect of
the removal of suffering—and compassion has the promotion of the aspect of
the removal of suffering as its characteristic; and then, on seeing the success of
those whose welfare has been wished for and the removal of whose suffering
has been wished for, they should be practiced as being glad—and gladness has
the act of gladdening as its characteristic; but after that there is nothing to be
done and so they should be practiced as the neutral aspect, in other words, the
state of an onlooker—and equanimity has the promotion of the aspect of
neutrality as its characteristic; therefore, since their respective aims are the aspect
of welfare, etc., their order should be understood to correspond, with loving-
kindness stated first, then compassion, gladness and equanimity.
110. All of them, however, occur with a measureless scope, for their scope is
measureless beings; and instead of assuming a measure such as "Loving-
kindness, etc., should be developed only towards a single being, or in an area of
such an extent," they occur with universal pervasion.
That is why it was said: [322]
Their number four is due to paths to purity
And other sets of four; their order to their aim
As welfare and the rest. Their scope is found to be
Immeasurable, so "measureless states" their name.
[As Producing Three Jhanas and Four Jhanas]
111. Though they have a single characteristic in having a measureless scope,
vet the first three are only of triple and quadruple jhana [respectively in the
fourfold and fivefold reckonings]. Why? Because they are not dissociated from
16. Sambhavetva—"judging": not in this sense in PED. Vism-mht (p. 313) explains by
parikappetvd (conjecturing).
`316
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
joy. But why are their aims not dissociated from joy? Because they are the escape
from ill will, etc., which are originated by grief. But the last one belongs only to
the remaining single jhana. Why? Because it is associated with equanimous
feeling. For the divine abiding of equanimity that occurs in the aspect of neutrality
towards beings does not exist apart from equanimous [that is to say neither-
painful-nor-pleasant] feeling.
112. However, someone might say this: "It has been said by the Blessed One in
the Book of Eights, speaking of the measureless states in general: 'Next, bhikkhu,
you should develop the concentration with applied thought and sustained
thought, and vou should develop it without applied thought and with sustained
thought only and vou should develop it without applied thought and without
sustained thought, and you should develop it with happiness, and you should
develop it without happiness, and you should develop it accompanied by
gratification, and vou should develop it accompanied by equanimity' (A IV 300).
Consequently all four measureless states have quadruple and quintuple jhana."
113.	He should be told: "Do not put it like that. For if that were so, then
contemplation of the body, etc., would also have quadruple and quintuple jhana.
But there is not even the first jhana in the contemplation of feeling or in the other
two.17 So do not misrepresent the Blessed One by adherence to the letter. The
Enlightened One's word is profound and should be taken as it is intended,
giving due weight to the teachers."
114.	And the intention here is this: The Blessed One, it seems, was asked to
teach the Dhamma thus: "Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One
would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Blessed One's
Dhamma, I may dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent and self-exerted" (A
IV 299). But the Blessed One had no confidence yet in that bhikkhu, since although
he had already heard the Dhamma he had nevertheless gone on living there
instead of going to do the ascetic's duties, [and the Blessed One expressed his
lack of confidence] thus: "So too, some misguided men merely question me, and
when the Dhamma is expounded [to them], they still fancy that they need not
follow me" (A IV 299). However, the bhikkhu had the potentiality for the
attainment of Arahantship, and so he advised him again, [323] saying: "Therefore,
bhikkhu, you should train thus: 'My mind shall be steadied, quite steadied
internally and arisen evil unprofitable things shall not obsess my mind and
17.	For which kinds of body contemplation give which kinds of concentration see
8.43 and M-a I 247.
18.	"'Mere wiificntioi i of the mil id': the kind of concentrating (sanmdhai ui) that is undeveloped
and just obtained by one in pursuit of development. That is called 'basic concentration/
however, since it is the basic reason for the kinds of more distinguished concentration to
be mentioned later in this connection. This 'mere unification of the mind' is intended as
momentary concentration as in the passage beginning, 'I internally settled, steadied,
unified and concentrated my mind' (M I 116). For the first unification of the mind is
recognized as momentary concentration here as it is in the first of the two successive
descriptions: 'Tireless energy was aroused in me ... my mind was concentrated and
unified' followed by 'Quite secluded from sense desires ...'" (MI 21) (Vism-mht 314).
`317
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
remain.' You should train thus" (A IV 299). But what is stated in that advice is
basic concentration consisting in mere unification of mind18 internally in the
sense of in oneself (see Ch. XIV n. 75).
115. After that he told him about its development by means of loving-kindness
in order to show that he should not rest content with just that much but should
intensify his basic concentration in this way: "As soon as your mind has become
steadied, quite steadied internally bhikkhu, and arisen evil unprofitable things
do not obsess your mind and remain, then you should train thus: 'The mind-
deliverance of loving-kindness will be developed by me, frequently practiced,
made the vehicle, made the foundation, established, consolidated, and properly
undertaken.' You should train thus, bhikkhu" (A IV 299-300), after which he
said further: "As soon as this concentration has been thus developed by you,
bhikkhu,19 and frequently practiced, then you should develop this concentration
with applied thought and sustained thought ... and you should develop it
accompanied by equanimity" (A IV 300).
116.	The meaning is this: "Bhikkhu, when this basic concentration has been
developed by you by means of loving-kindness, then, instead of resting content
with just that much, vou should make this basic concentration reach quadruple
and quintuple jhana in other objects by [further] developing it in the wav
beginning 'With applied thought.'"
117.	And having spoken thus, he further said: "As soon as this concentration
has been thus developed by you, bhikkhu, and frequently practiced, then you
should train thus: The mind-deliverance of compassion will be developed by
me ...' (A IV 300), etc., pointing out that "you should effect its [further]
development by means of quadruple and quintuple jhana in other objects, this
[further] development being preceded by the remaining divine abidings of
compassion and the rest."
118.	Having thus shown how its [further] development by means of quadruple
and quintuple jhana is preceded by loving-kindness, etc., and having told him,
"As soon as this concentration has been developed by you, bhikkhu, and
frequently practiced, then vou should train thus: T shall dwell contemplating
the body as a body/" etc., he concluded the discourse with Arahantship as its
culmination thus: "As soon as this concentration has been developed by you,
bhikkhu, completely developed, then wherever you go you will go in comfort,
wherever vou stand vou will stand in comfort, wherever [324] vou sit you will sit
in comfort, wherever you make your couch you will do so in comfort" (A IV 301).
From that it must be understood that the [three] beginning with loving-kindness
have only triple-quadruple jhana, and that equanimity has only the single
19. "'Thus developed': just as a fire started with wood and banked up with cowdung,
dust, etc., although it arrives at the state of a 'cowdung fire/ etc., (cf. M I 259) is
nevertheless called after the original fire that was started with the wood, so too it is
the basic concentration that is spoken of here, taking it as banked up with loving-
kindness, and so on. 'In other objects' means in such objects as the earth kasina"
(Vism-mht 315).
`318
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
remaining jhana. And thev are expounded in the same wav in the Abhidhamma
as well.
[The Highest Limit of Each]
119. And while they are twofold by way of the triple-quadruple jhana and the
single remaining jhana, still they should be understood to be distinguishable in
each case by a different efficacy consisting in having "beauty as the highest,"
etc. For they are so described in the Haliddavasana Sutta, according as it is said:
"Bhikkhus, the mind-deliverance of loving-kindness has beauty as the highest,
I say ... The mind-deliverance of compassion has the base consisting of boundless
space as the highest, I say ... The mind-deliverance of gladness has the base
consisting of boundless consciousness as the highest I say ... The mind-
deliverance of equanimity has the base consisting of nothingness as the highest,
I say" (S V 119-21).20
120.	But why are thev described in this way? Because each is the respective
basic support for each. For beings are unrepulsive to one who abides in loving-
kindness. Being familiar with the unrepulsive aspect, when he applies his mind
to unrepulsive pure colours such as blue-black, his mind enters into them without
difficulty. So loving-kindness is the basic support for the liberation bv the beautiful
(see M II12; M-a III 256), but not for what is beyond that. That is why it is called
"having beauty as the highest."
121.	One who abides in compassion has come to know thoroughly the danger
in materiality since compassion is aroused in him when he sees the suffering of
beings that has as its material sign (cause) beating with sticks, and so on. So,
well knowing the danger in materiality when he removes whichever kasina
[concept he was contemplating], whether that of the earth kasina or another, and
applies his mind to the space [that remains (see X.6)], which is the escape from
materiality, then his mind enters into that [space] without difficulty. So
compassion is the basic support for the sphere of boundless space, but not for
what is beyond that. That is why it is called "having the base consisting of
boundless space as the highest."
122. When he abides in gladness, his mind becomes familiar with
apprehending consciousness, since gladness is aroused in him when he sees
beings' consciousness arisen in the form of rejoicing over some reason for joy.
Then when he surmounts the sphere of boundless space that he had already
attained in due course and applies his mind to the consciousness that had as its
object the sign of space, [325] his mind enters into it without difficulty. So gladness
is the basic support for the base consisting of boundless consciousness, but not
for what is beyond that. That is why it is called "having the sphere of boundless
consciousness as the highest."
--
20.	"The beautiful" (sublia) is the third of the eight liberations (vimokklia—see MII12;
M-a III 255).
21.	Reading in both cases "avijjaiimia-gahana-dakkham cittam," not "-dukkham."'"Because
it has no more concern (dbhoga)': because it has no further act of being concerned
`319
Chapter IX
The Divine Abidings
123. When he abides in equanimity, his mind becomes skilled21 in appre-
hending what is (in the ultimate sense) non-existent, because his mind has been
diverted from apprehension of (what is existent in) the ultimate sense, namely
pleasure, (release from) pain, etc., owing to having no further concern such as
"May beings be happy" or "Mav they be released from pain" or "May they not
lose the success thev have obtained." Now his mind has become used to being
diverted from apprehension of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense, and his
mind has become skilled in apprehending what is non-existent in the ultimate
sense, (that is to say, living beings, which are a concept), and so when he
surmounts the base consisting of boundless consciousness attained in due
course and applies his mind to the absence, which is non-existent as to individual
essence, of consciousness, which is a realitv (is become—see M I 260) in the
ultimate sense, then his mind enters into that (nothingness, that non-existence)
without difficulty (see X.32). So equanimity is the basic support for the base
consisting of nothingness, but not for what is beyond that. That is why it is
called "having the base consisting of nothingness as the highest."
124. When he has understood thus that the special efficacy of each resides
respectively in "having beauty as the highest," etc., he should besides
understand how they bring to perfection all the good states beginning with
giving. For the Great Beings' minds retain their balance by giving preference to
beings' welfare, by dislike of beings' suffering, by desire for the various successes
achieved by beings to last, and by impartiality towards all beings. And to all
beings they give gifts, which are a source a pleasure, without discriminating
thus: "It must be given to this one; it must not be given to this one." And in order
to avoid doing harm to beings they undertake the precepts of virtue. They practice
renunciation for the purpose of perfecting their virtue. They cleanse their
understanding for the purpose of non-confusion about what is good and bad for
beings. They constantly arouse energy, having beings' welfare and happiness at
heart. When they have acquired heroic fortitude through supreme energy, they
become patient with beings' many kinds of faults. They do not deceive when
--
(abhujana) by hoping (dsimsand) for their pleasure, etc., thus 'May they be happy.' The
development of loving-kindness, etc., occurring as it does in the form of hope for
beings' pleasure, etc., makes them its object by directing [the mind] to apprehension
of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense [i.e. pleasure, etc.]. But development of
equanimity instead of occurring like that, makes beings its object bv simply looking
on. But does not the divine abiding of equanimity itself too make beings its object by
directing the mind to apprehension of [what is existent in] the ultimate sense, because
of the words, 'Beings are owners of their deeds. Whose [if not theirs] is the choice by
which they will become happy ...?' (§96)—Certainly that is so. But that is in the prior
stage of development of equanimity When it has reached its culmination, it makes
beings its object by simply looking on. So its occurrence is specially occupied with
what is non-existent in the ultimate sense [i.e. beings, which are a concept]. And so
skill in apprehending the non-existent should be understood as avoidance of
bewilderment due to misrepresentation in apprehension of beings, which avoidance
of bewilderment has reached absorption" (Vism-mht).

promising "We shall give you this; we shall do this for you." They are unshakably
resolute upon beings' welfare and happiness. Through unshakable loving-kindness
they place them first [before themselves]. Through equanimity they expect no
reward. Having thus fulfilled the [ten] perfections, these [divine abidings] then
perfect all the good states classed as the ten powers, the four kinds of fearlessness,
the six kinds of knowledge not shared [bv disciples], and the eighteen states of
the Enlightened One.22 This is how they bring to perfection all the good states
beginning with giving.

Chapter X
The Immaterial States
(Aruppa-iiiddesa)
[(1) The Base Consisting of Boundless Space]
1.	[326] Now, as to the four immaterial states mentioned next to the divine
abidings (III. 105), one who wants firstly to develop the base consisting of
boundless space sees in gross physical matter danger through the wielding of
sticks, etc., because of the words: "Tt is in virtue of matter that wielding of sticks,
wielding of knives, quarrels, brawls and disputes takes place; but that does not
exist at all in the immaterial state/ and in this expectation he enters upon the
way to dispassion for only material things, for the fading and cessation of onlv
those" (M I 410); and he sees danger in it too through the thousand afflictions
beginning with eye disease. So, in order to surmount that, he enters upon the
fourth jhana in anv one of the nine kasinas beginning with the earth kasina and
omitting the limited-space kasina.
2.	Now, although he has already surmounted gross physical matter by means
of the fourth jhana of the fine-material sphere, nevertheless he still wants also to
surmount the kasina materiality since it is the counterpart of the former. How
does he do this?
3.	Suppose a timid man is pursued by a snake in a forest and flees from it as
fast as he can, then if he sees in the place he has fled to a palm leaf with a streak
painted on it or a creeper or a rope or a crack in the ground, he is fearful, anxious
and will not even look at it. Suppose again a man is living in the same village as
a hostile man who ill-uses him and on being threatened bv him with a flogging
and the burning down of his house, he goes away to live in another village, then
if he meets another man there of similar appearance, voice and manner, he is
fearful, anxious and will not even look at him.
4.	Here is the application of the similes. The time when the bhikkhu has the
gross physical matter as his object is like the time when the men were respectively
threatened by the snake and by the enemy [327] The time when the bhikkhu
surmounts the gross physical matter by means of the fourth jhana of the fine-
material sphere is like the first man's fleeing as fast as he can and the other
man's going away to another village. The bhikkhu's observing that even the
matter of the kasina is the counterpart of that gross physical matter and his
wanting to surmount that also is like the first man's seeing in the place he had
`322
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
ffled to the palm leaf with a streak painted on it, etc., and the other man's seeing
the man who resembled the enemy in the village he had left, and their
unwillingness to look owing to fear and anxiety.
And here the similes of the dog attacked by a boar and that of the pisaca goblin
and the timid man1 should be understood too.
5. So when he has thus become disgusted with (dispassionate towards) the
kasina materiality the object of the fourth jhana, and wants to get away from it,
he achieves mastery in the five ways. Then on emerging from the now familiar
fourth jhana of the fine-material sphere, he sees the danger in that jhana in this
way: "This makes its object the materiality with which I have become disgusted,"
and "It has joy as its near enemy" and "It is grosser than the peaceful liberations."
There is, however, no [comparative] grossness of factors here [as in the case of the
four fine-material jhanas]; for the immaterial states have the same two factors as
this fine-material [jhana].
6.	When he has seen the danger in that [fine-material fourth jhana] jhana in
this way and has ended his attachment to it, he gives his attention to the base
consisting of boundless space as peaceful. Then, when he has spread out the
kasina to the limit of the world-sphere, or as far as he likes, he removes the kasina
[materiality] by giving his attention to the space touched by it, [regarding that]
as "space" or "boundless space."
7.	When he is removing it, he neither folds it up like a mat nor withdraws it like
a cake from a tin. It is simply that he does not advert to it or give attention to it or
review it; it is when he neither adverts to it nor gives attention to it nor reviews it,
but gives his attention exclusively to the space touched by it, [regarding that] as
"space, space," that he is said to "remove the kasina."
8.	And when the kasina is being removed, it does not roll up or roll away. It is
simply that it is called "removed" on account of his non-attention to it, his
attention being given to "space, space." This is conceptualized as the mere
space left by the removal of the kasina [materiality]. Whether it is called "space
left by the removal of the kasina" or "space touched by the kasina" or "space
secluded from the kasina," it is all the same.
9.	He adverts again and again to the sign of the space left bv the removal of the
kasina [328] as "space, space," and strikes at it with thought and applied
thought. As he adverts to it again and again and strikes at it with thought and
applied thought, the hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established
and his mind becomes concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again and
again, develops and repeatedly practices it.
10.	As he again and again adverts to it and gives attention to it in this way,
consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space arises in
1. "A dog, it seems, was attacked in the forest by a boar and fled. When it was dusk
he saw in the distance a cauldron for boiling rice, and perceiving it as a boar, he fled in
fear and terror. Again, a man who was afraid of pisdca goblins saw a decapitated palm
stump at night in a place that was unfamiliar to him, and perceiving it as a pisaca
goblin, he fell down in his fear, horror and confusion" (Vism-mht 320).
`323
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
absorption with the space [as its object], as the consciousness belonging to the
fine-material sphere did in the case of the earth kasina, and so on. And here too
in the prior stage there are either three or four sensual-sphere impulsions
associated with equanimous feeling, while the fourth or the fifth is of the
immaterial sphere. The rest is the same as in the case of the earth kasina (IV74).
11. There is, however, this difference. When the immaterial-sphere conscious-
ness has arisen in this way, the bhikkhu, who has been formerly looking at the
kasina disk with the jhana eye finds himself looking at only space after that sign
has been abruptly removed by the attention given in the preliminary work thus
"space, space." He is like a man who has plugged an opening in a [covered]
vehicle, a sack or a pot2 with a piece of blue rag or with a piece of rag of some
such colour as yellow, red or white and is looking at that, and then when the rag
is removed by the force of the wind or by some other agency, he finds himself
looking at space.
[Text and Commentary]
12.	And at this point it is said: "With the complete surmounting (samatikkama)
of perceptions of matter, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance,
with non-attention to perceptions of variety [aware of] 'unbounded space/ he
enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space" (Vibh 245).
13.	Herein, complete is in all aspects or of all [perceptions]; without exception,
is the meaning. Of perceptions of matter: both (a) of the fine-material jhanas
mentioned [here] under the heading of "perception," and (b) of those things
that are their object. For (a) the jhana of the fine-material sphere is called "matter"
in such passages as "Possessed of visible matter he sees instances of matter" (D
II 70; M II 12), and (b) it is its object too [that is called "matter"] in such passages
as "He sees instances of visible matter externally ... fair and ugly" (D II 110; M
II 13).3 Consequently, here the words "perception of matter" (rupa-sanna—lit.
"matter-perceptions"), in the sense of "perceptions about matter," are used (a)
for fine-material jhana stated thus under the headings of "perceptions." [Also]
(b) it has the label (sanna) "matter" (nipa), thus it (the jliana's object) is "labelled
matter" (rupa-sanna); what is meant is that "matter" is its name. So it should be
understood that this is also a term for (b) what is classed as the earth kasina, etc.,
which is the object of that [jhana].4 [329]
2.	PED, this ref. reads ydnaputosd for yanapatoli, taking it as one compound (see
under yana and mutoli, but this does not fit the context happily. Vism-mht (p. 321) has:
"'YanappatoUhimbliinmkliadJnan' ti ogiintharia-sivikadi-yanarn niukham = yana-mukhatn;
patoUya kuddakadvarassa nmkliam = patoU-nmkliam; kwnbhi-nmkltan ti paccekam mukha-

the first of the eight bases of mastery (See M-a III 255ff.).

and as the [objective] sign, signal or label perceived.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
14.	With the surmounting: with the fading away and with the cessation. What is
meant? With the fading away and with the cessation, both because of the fading
away and because of the cessation, either in all aspects or without exception, of
these perceptions of matter, reckoned as jhana, which number fifteen with the
[five each of the] profitable, resultant and functional,5 and also of these things
labelled matter, reckoned as objects [of those perceptions], which number nine
with the earth kasina, etc., (§1) he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting
of boundless space. For he cannot enter upon and dwell in that without completely
surmounting perceptions of matter.
15.	Herein, there is no surmounting of these perceptions in one whose greed
for the object [of those perceptions] has not faded away; and when the perceptions
have been surmounted, their objects have been surmounted as well. That is why
in the Vibhanga only the surmounting of the perceptions and not that of the
objects is mentioned as follows: "Herein, what are perceptions of matter? They
are the perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in one who has attained a fine-
material-sphere attainment or in one who has been reborn there or in one who is
abiding in bliss there in this present life. These are what are called perceptions
of matter. These perceptions of matter are passed, surpassed, surmounted. Hence,
'With the complete surmounting of perceptions of matter' is said" (Vibh 261).
But this commentary should be understood to deal also with the surmounting
of the object because these attainments have to be reached by surmounting the
object; they are not to be reached by retaining the same object as in the first and
subsequent jhanas.
16. With the disappearance of perceptions of resistance: perceptions of resistance
are perceptions arisen through the impact of the physical base consisting of the
eve, etc., and the respective objects consisting of visible objects etc.; and this is a
term for perception of visible objects (rupa) and so on, according as it is said:
"Here, what are perceptions of resistance? Perceptions of visible objects,
perceptions of sounds, perceptions of odours, perceptions of flavours, perceptions
of tangible objects—these are called 'perceptions of resistance'" (Vibh 261);
with the complete disappearance, the abandoning, the non-arising, of these ten
kinds of perceptions of resistance, that is to say ot the five profitable-resultant
and five unprofitable-resultant;6 causing their non-occurrence, is what is meant.
17. Of course, these are not to be found in one who has entered upon the first
jhana, etc., either; for consciousness at that time does not occur by way of the five
doors. Still [330] the mention of them here should be understood as a
recommendation of this jhana for the purpose of arousing interest in it, just as in
the case of the fourth jhana there is mention of the pleasure and pain already
abandoned elsewhere, and in the case of the third path there is mention of the
[false] view of personality etc., already abandoned earlier.
5.	See XIV129, description of perception aggregate, which is classified in the same
way as the consciousness aggregate. Those referred to here are the fifteen fine-
material kinds, corresponding to nos. (9-13), (57-61) and (81-85) in Table III.
6.	See XIV96f. nos. (34-38) and (50-54) in Table III.
`325
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
18.	Or alternatively, though these are also not to be found in one who has
attained the fine-material sphere, still their not being there is not due to their
having been abandoned; for development of the fine-material sphere does not
lead to fading of greed for materiality and the occurrence of those [fine-material
jhanas] is actually dependent on materiality But this development [of the
immaterial] does lead to the fading of greed for materiality Therefore it is allowable
to say that they are actually abandoned here; and not only to say it, but to
maintain it absolutely
19.	In fact it is because they have not been abandoned already before this that
it was said by the Blessed One that sound is a thorn to one who has the first
jhana (A V 135). And it is precisely because they are abandoned here that the
imperturbability (see Vibh 135) of the immaterial attainments and their state of
peaceful liberation are mentioned (M I 33), and that Alara Kalama neither saw
the five hundred carts that passed close by him nor heard the sound of them
while he was in an immaterial attainment (D II 130).
20. With non-attention to perceptions of variety: either to perceptions occurring with
variety as their domain or to perceptions themselves various. For "perceptions of
variety" are so called [for two reasons]: firstly because the kinds of perception included
along with the mind element and mind-consciousness element in one who has not
attained—which kinds are intended here as described in the Vibhanga thus: "Herein,
what are perceptions of variety? The perception, perceiving, perceivedness, in
one who has not attained and possesses either mind element or mind-
consciousness element in one who has not attained and possesses either mind
element or mind-consciousness element: these are called 'perceptions of variety'"
(Vibh 261)—occur with respect to a domain that is varied in individual essence
with the variety classed as visible-object, sound, etc.; and secondly because the
forty-four kinds of perception—that is to say eight kinds of sense-sphere
profitable perception, twelve kinds of unprofitable perception, eleven kinds of
sense-sphere profitable resultant perception, two kinds of unprofitable-resultant
perception, and eleven kinds of sense-sphere functional perception—themselves
have variety, have various individual essences, and are dissimilar from each
other. With the complete non-attention to, non-adverting to, non-reaction to,
non-reviewing of, these perceptions of variety; what is meant is that because he
does not advert to them, give them attention or review them, therefore ...
21. And [two things] should be understood: firstly that their absence is stated
here in two ways as "surmounting" and "disappearance" because the earlier
perceptions of matter and perceptions of resistance do not exist even in the kind
of existence produced by this jhana on rebirth, let alone when this jhana is
entered upon and dwelt in that existence; [331] and secondly, in the case of
perceptions of variety "non-attention" to them is said because twenty-seven
kinds of perception—that is to say, eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable
perception, nine kinds of functional perception, and ten kinds of unprofitable
perception—still exist in the kind of existence produced by this jhana. For when
he enters upon and dwells in this jhana there too, he does so by non-attention to
them also, but he has not attained when he does give attention to them.
`326
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
22.	And here briefly it should be understood that the abandoning of all fine-
material-sphere states is signified by the words with the surmounting of perceptions
of matter, and the abandoning of and non-attention to all sense-sphere
consciousness and its concomitants is signified by the words with the
disappearance of perceptions of resistance, with non-attention to perceptions of variety.
23.	Unbounded space: here it is called "unbounded" (ananta, lit. endless) because
neither its end as its arising nor its end as its fall are made known.7 It is the space
left by the removal of the kasina that is called "space." And here unboundedness
(endlessness) should be understood as [referring to] the attention also, which is
why it is said in the Vibhanga: "He places, settles his consciousness in that
space, he pervades unboundedly (anantam), hence 'unbounded (ananto) space'
is said" (Vibh 262).
24.	He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless space: it has no
bound (anta), and thus it is unbounded (ananta). What is spatially unbounded
(dkdsam anantam) is unbounded space (dkdsdnantam). Unbounded space is the
same as boundless space (dkdsdnancam—lit. space-boundlessness). That
"boundless space" is a "base" (dyatana) in the sense of habitat for the jhana
whose nature it is to be associated with it, as the "deities' base" is for deities,
thus it is the "base consisting of boundless space" (akasdnancdyatana). He enters
and dwells in: having reached that base consisting of boundless space, having
caused it to be produced, he dwells (viharati) with an abiding (vihdra) consisting
in postures that are in conformity with it.
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless space as
a meditation subject.
[(2) The Base Consisting of Boundless Consciousness]
25. When he wants to develop the base consisting of boundless consciousness,
he must first achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment of the base
consisting of boundless space. Then he should see the danger in the base
consisting of boundless space in this way: "This attainment has fine-material
I	7
jhana as its near enemy, and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting of
boundless consciousness." So having ended his attachment to that, he should
give his attention to the base consisting of boundless consciousness as peaceful,
adverting again and again as "consciousness, consciousness" to the
consciousness that occurred pervading that space [as its object]. He should give
it attention, review it, and strike at it with applied and sustained thought; [332]
but he should not give attention [simply] in this way "boundless, boundless."8
7.	"A [formed] dhamma with an individual essence is delimited by rise and fall
because it is produced after having not been, and because after having been it vanishes.
But space is called boundless since it has neither rise nor fall because it is a dhamma
without individual essence" (Vism-mht 323).
8.	"He should not give attention to it only as 'Boundless, boundless;' instead of
developing it thus, he should give attention to it as 'Boundless consciousness, boundless
consciousness' or as 'Consciousness, consciousness'" (Vism-mht 324).
`327
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
26.	As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way, the
hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established, and his mind becomes
concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again and again, develops and
repeatedly practices it. As he does so, consciousness belonging to the base
consisting of boundless consciousness arises in absorption with the [past]
consciousness that pervaded the space [as its object], just as that belonging to
the base consisting of boundless space did with the space [as its object]. But the
method of explaining the process of absorption should be understood in the
way already described.
[Text and Commentary]
27.	And at this point it is said: "By completely surmounting (samatikkamma)
the base consisting of boundless space, [aware of] 'unbounded consciousness,'
he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness"
28.	Herein, completely is as already explained. By ... surmounting the base
consisting of boundless space: the jhana is called the "base consisting of boundless
space" in the way already stated (§24), and its object is so called too. For the
object, too, is "boundless space" (akasanaficam) in the way already stated (§24),
and then, because it is the object of the first immaterial jhana, it is its "base" in
the sense of habitat, as the "deities' base" is for deities, thus it is the "base
consisting of boundless space." Likewise: it is "boundless space," and then,
because it is the cause of the jhana's being of that species, it is its "base" in the
sense of locality of the species, as Kamboja is the "base" of horses, thus it is the
"base consisting of boundless space" in this way also. So it should be understood
that the words, "By ... surmounting the base consisting of boundless space"
include both [the jhana and its object] together, since this base consisting of
boundless consciousness is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by
surmounting, by causing the non-occurrence of, and by not giving attention to,
both the jhana and its object.
29.	Unbounded consciousness: What is meant is that he gives his attention thus
"unbounded consciousness" to that same consciousness that occurred in
pervading [as its object the space] as "unbounded space." Or "unbounded"
refers to the attention. For when he gives attention without reserve to the
consciousness that had the space as its object, then the attention he gives to it is
"unbounded."
30. For it is said in the Vibhanga: "'Unbounded consciousness': he gives
attention to that same space pervaded by consciousness, he pervades boundlessly
hence 'unbounded consciousness' is said" (Vibh 262). But in that passage (tam
yeva akasam vinnanena phutam) the instrumental case "by consciousness" must
be understood in the sense of accusative; for the teachers of the commentary
explain its meaning in that way What is meant by "He pervades boundlessly" is
that "he gives attention to that same consciousness which had pervaded that
space" (tain yeva akasam phutam vinndnam).
`328
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
31. He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of boundless consciousness:
[333] it has no bound (anta, lit. end), thus it is unbounded (ananta). What is
unbounded is boundless (dnanca lit. unboundedness), and unbounded
consciousness is called "boundless consciousness," that is "vinndnancam" [in
the contracted form] instead of "vinndndnancam” [which is the full number of
syllables]. This is an idiomatic form. That boundless consciousness (vinndnanca)
is the base (dyatana) in the sense of foundation for the jhana whose nature it is to
be associated with it, as the "deities' base" is for deities, thus it is the "base
consisting of boundless consciousness" (vinndnancdyatana). The rest is the same
as before.
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of boundless
consciousness as a meditation subject.
[(3) The Base Consisting of Nothingness]
32.	When he wants to develop the base consisting of nothingness, he must first
achieve mastery in the five ways in the attainment in the base consisting of
boundless consciousness. Then he should see the danger in the base consisting
of boundless consciousness in this way: "This attainment has the base consisting
of boundless space as its near enemy, and it is not as peaceful as the base
consisting of nothingness." So having ended his attachment to that, he should
give his attention to the base consisting of nothingness as peaceful. He should
give attention to the [present] non-existence, voidness, secluded aspect, of that
same [past] consciousness belonging to the base consisting of boundless space,
which became the object of [the consciousness belonging to] the base consisting
of boundless consciousness. How does he do this?
33.	Without giving [further] attention to that consciousness, he should [now]
advert again and again in this way "there is not, there is not," or "void, void," or
"secluded, secluded," and give his attention to it, review it, and strike at it with
thought and applied thought.
34.	As he directs his mind on to that sign thus, the hindrances are suppressed,
mindfulness is established, and his mind becomes concentrated in access. He
cultivates that sign again and again, develops and repeatedly practices it. As he
does so, consciousness belonging to the base consisting of nothingness arises
in absorption, making its object the void, secluded, non-existent state of that
same [past] exalted consciousness that occurred in pervading the space, just as
the [consciousness belonging to the] base consisting of boundless consciousness
did the [then past] exalted consciousness that had pervaded the space. And
here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in the
way already described.
35. But there is this difference. Suppose a man sees a community of bhikkhus
gathered together in a meeting hall or some such place and then goes elsewhere;
then after the bhikkhus have risen at the conclusion of the business for which
they had met and have departed, the man comes back, and as he stands in the
doorway looking at that place again, he sees it only as void, he sees it only as
secluded, he does not think, "So many bhikkhus have died, so many have left the
`329
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
district," but rather [334] he sees only the non-existence thus, "This is void,
secluded"—so too, having formerly dwelt seeing with the jhana eye belonging
to the base consisting of boundless consciousness the [earlier] consciousness
that had occurred making the space its object, [now] when that consciousness
has disappeared owing to his giving attention to the preliminary work in the
way beginning, "There is not, there is not," he dwells seeing only its non-
existence, in other words, its departedness when this consciousness has arisen
in absorption.
[Text and Commentary]
36. And at this point it is said: "Bv completely surmounting the base consisting
of boundless consciousness, [aware that] 'There is nothing/ he enters upon and
dwells in the base consisting of nothingness" (Vibh 245).
37.	Herein, completely is as already explained. By ... surmounting the base
consisting of boundless consciousness: here too the jhana is called the "base
consisting of boundless consciousness" in the way already stated, and its object
is so-called too. For the object too is "boundless consciousness" (vifimnancam)
in the wav already stated, and then, because it is the object of the second immaterial
jhana, it is its "base" in the sense of habitat, as the "deities' base" is for deities,
thus it is the "base consisting of boundless consciousness." Likewise it is
"boundless consciousness," and then because it is the cause of the jhana's
being of that species, it is its "base" in the sense of locality of the species, as
Kamboja is the "base" of horses, thus it is the "base consisting of boundless
consciousness" in this way also. So it should be understood that the words, "Bv
... surmounting the base consisting of boundless consciousness" include both
[the jhana and its object] together, since this base consisting of nothingness is to
be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting, by causing the non-
occurrence of, by not giving attention to, both jhana and its object.
38.	There is nothing (natthi kind): what is meant is that he gives his attention
thus, "there is not, there is not," or "void, void," or "secluded, secluded." It is
said in the Vibhanga: "There is nothing': he makes that same consciousness
non-existent, makes it absent, makes it disappear, sees that 'there is nothing',
hence 'there is nothing' is said" (Vibh 262), which is expressed in a way that
resembles comprehension [by insight] of liability to destruction, nevertheless
the meaning should be understood in the way described above. For the words
"He makes that same consciousness non-existent, makes it absent, makes it
disappear" are said of one who does not advert to it or gives attention to it or
review it, and only gives attention to its non-existence, its voidness, its
secludedness; they are not meant in the other way (Cf. XXI.17).
39. He enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of nothingness: it has no owning
(kincana),9 this it is non-owning (akincana); what is meant is that it has not even
9. There is a play on the words natthi kind ("there is nothing") and akincana ("non-
owning"). At M I 298 there occurs the expression "Rago kho avuso kincano (greed,
friend, is an owning)," which is used in connection with this attainment. The
`330
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
the mere act of its dissolution remaining. The state (essence) of non-owning is
nothingness (dkincanna). This is a term for the disappearance of the consciousness
belonging to the base consisting of boundless space. [335] That nothingness is
the "base" in the sense of foundation for that jhana, as the "deities' base" is for
deities, thus it is the "base consisting of nothingness." The rest is as before.
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of nothingness as a
meditation subject.
[(4) The Base Consisting of Neither Perception nor Non-Perception]
40. When, however, he wants to develop the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception, he must first achieve mastery in the five wavs in
the attainment of the base consisting of nothingness. Then he should see the
danger in the base consisting of nothingness and the advantage in what is
superior to it in this way: "This attainment has the base consisting of boundless
consciousness as its near enemy, and it is not as peaceful as the base consisting
of neither perception nor non-perception," or in this way: "Perception is a boil,
perception is a dart ... this is peaceful, this is sublime, that is to say, neither
perception nor non-perception" (M II 231). So having ended his attachment to
the base consisting of nothingness, he should give attention to the base consisting
of neither perception non non-perception as peaceful. He should advert again
and again to that attainment of the base consisting of nothingness that has
occurred making non-existence its object, adverting to it as "peaceful, peaceful,"
and he should give his attention to it, review it and strike at it with thought and
applied thought.
41. As he directs his mind again and again on to that sign in this way, the
hindrances are suppressed, mindfulness is established, and his mind becomes
concentrated in access. He cultivates that sign again and again, develops and
repeatedly practices it. As he does so, consciousness belonging to the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception arises in absorption making
its object the four [mental] aggregates that constitute the attainment of the base
consisting of nothingness, just as the [consciousness belonging to the] base
consisting of nothingness did the disappearance of the [previous] consciousness.
And here too the method of explaining the absorption should be understood in
the wav already described.
[Text and Commentary]
42. And at this point it is said: "By completely surmounting the base consisting
of nothingness he enters upon and dwells in the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception" (Vibh 245).

why it is called an owning)" (Cf. M-a 127; also XXI.53 and note 19). Vism-mht (p. 327)
here says "Kincanan ti kind pi." The word kincati is not in PED.
`331
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
43. Herein, completely is already explained. By ... surmounting the base consisting
of nothingness: here too the jhana is called the "base consisting of nothingness"
in the way already stated, and its object is so called too. For the object too is
"nothingness" (dkincannam) in the way already stated, and then because it is the
object of the third immaterial jhana, it is its "base" in the sense of habitat, as the
"deities' base" is for deities, thus it is the "base consisting of nothingness."
Likewise: it is "nothingness," and then, because it is the cause of the jhana's
being of that species, it is its "base" in the sense of locality of the species, as
Kamboja is the "base" of horses, thus it is the "base consisting of nothingness"
in this way also. [336] So it should be understood that the words, "By ...
surmounting the base consisting of nothingness" include both [the jhana and
its object] together, since the base consisting of neither perception nor non-
perception is to be entered upon and dwelt in precisely by surmounting, by
causing the non-occurrence of, by not giving attention to, both the jhana and its
object.
44.	Base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception: then there is he who
so practices that there is in him the perception on account of the presence of
which this [attainment] is called the "the base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception," and in the Vibhanga, in order to point out that [person],
firstly one specified as "neither percipient nor non-percipient," it is said, "gives
attention to that same base consisting of nothingness as peaceful, he develops
the attainment with residual formations, hence 'neither percipient nor non-
percipient' is said" (Vibh 263).
45.	Herein, he gives attention ... as peaceful, means that he gives attention to it as
"peaceful" because of the peacefulness of the object thus: "How peaceful this
attainment is; for it can make even non-existence its object and still subsist!"
If he brings it to mind as "peaceful" then how does there come to be
surmounting? Because there is no actual desire to attain it. For although he
gives attention to it as "peaceful," yet there is no concern in him or reaction or
attention such as "I shall advert to this" or "I shall attain this" or "I shall resolve
upon [the duration of] this." Why not? Because the base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception is more peaceful and better than the base
consisting of nothingness.
46. Suppose a king is proceeding along a city street with the great pomp of
royalty10 splendidly mounted on the back of an elephant, and he sees craftsmen
wearing one cloth tightly as a loin-cloth and another tied round their heads,
working at the various crafts such as ivory carving, etc., their limbs covered with
ivory dust, etc.; now while he is pleased with their skill, thinking, "How skilled
these craft-masters are, and what crafts thev practice!" he does not, however,
think, "Oh that I might abandon royalty and become a craftsman like that!"
Why not? Because of the great benefits in the majesty of kings; he leaves the
craftsmen behind and proceeds on his wav. So too, though this [meditator] gives
10. Mahacca (see D149 and D-a 1148); the form is not given in PED; probably a form
of mahatiya.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
attention to that attainment as "peaceful," yet there is no concern in him or
reaction or attention such as "I shall advert to this attainment" or "I shall attain
this" or "I shall resolve upon [the duration of] it" or "I shall emerge from it" or "I
shall review it."
47.	As he gives attention to it as "peaceful" in the way already described, [337]
he reaches the ultra-subtle absorbed perception in virtue of which he is called
"neither percipient nor non-percipient," and it is said of him that "He develops
the attainment with residual formations."
The attainment with residual formations is the fourth immaterial attainment
whose formations have reached a state of extreme subtletv.
48.	Now, in order to show the meaning of the kind of perception that has been
reached, on account of which [this jhana] is called the "base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception," it is said: "'Base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception': states of consciousness or its concomitants in one who has
attained the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception or in one
who has been reborn there or in one who is abiding in bliss there in this present
life" (Vibh 263). Of these, what is intended here is the states of consciousness
and its concomitants in one who has attained.
49.	The word meaning here is this: that jhana with its associated states neither
has perception nor has no perception because of the absence of gross perception
and the presence of subtle perception, thus it is "neither perception nor non-
perception" (;/' eva-sannd-ndsan funn). It is "neither perception nor non-perception"
and it is a "base" (dyatana) because it is included in the mind-base (mandyatana)
and the mental-object base (idhammdyatana), thus it is the "base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception" (nevasanndndsaiindyatana).
50.	Or alternatively: the perception here is neither perception, since it is
incapable of performing the decisive function of perception, nor yet non-
perception, since it is present in a subtle state as a residual formation, thus it is
"neither perception nor non-perception." It is "neither perception nor non-
perception" and it is a "base" in the sense of a foundation for the other states,
thus it is the "base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception."
And here it is not onlv perception that is like this, but feeling as well is
neither-feeling-nor-non-feeling, consciousness is neither-consciousness-nor-
non-consciousness, and contact is neither-contact-nor-non-contact, and the same
description applies to the rest of the associated states; but it should be understood
that this presentation is given in terms of perception.
51. And the meaning should be illustrated by the similes beginning with the
smearing of oil on the bowl. A novice smeared a bowl with oil, it seems, and laid
it aside. When it was time to drink gruel, an elder told him to bring the bowl. He
said, "Venerable sir, there is oil in the bowl." But then when he was told, "Bring
the oil, novice, I shall fill the oil tube," he replied, "There is no oil, venerable sir."
Herein, just as "There is oil" is in the sense of incompatibility with the gruel
because it has been poured into [the bowl] and just as "There is no oil" is in the
sense of filling the oil tube, etc., so too this perception is "neither perception" since
`333
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
it is incapable of performing the decisive function of perception and it is "nor non-
perception" because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation. [338]
52.	But in this context what is perception's function? It is the perceiving of the
object, and it is the production of dispassion if [that attainment and its object
are] made the objective field of insight. But it is not able to make the function of
perceiving decisive, as the heat element in tepid11 water is not able to make the
function of burning decisive; and it is not able to produce dispassion by treatment
of its objective field with insight in the way that perception is in the case of the
other attainments.
53.	There is in fact no bhikkhu capable of reaching dispassion by comprehension
of aggregates connected with the base consisting of neither perception nor non-
perception unless he has already done his interpreting with other aggregates (see
XX.21. and XXI.23). And furthermore, when the venerable Sariputta, or someone very
wise and naturally gifted with insight as he was, is able to do so, even he has to do
it bv means of comprehension of groups (XX.2) in this way "So it seems, these states,
not having been, come to be; having come to be, they vanish" (M III 28), and not by
means of [actual direct] insight into states one by one as they arise. Such is the
subtlety that this attainment reaches.
54.	And this meaning should be illustrated by the simile of the water on the
road, as it was by the simile of the oil-smearing on the bowl. A novice was
walking in front of an elder, it seems, who had set out on a journey He saw a
little water and said, "There is water, venerable sir, remove your sandals." Then
the elder said, "If there is water, bring me the bathing cloth and let us bathe," but
the novice said, "There is none, venerable sir." Herein, just as "There is water" is
in the sense of mere wetting of the sandals, and "There is none" is in the sense
of bathing, so too, this perception is "neither perception" since it is incapable of
performing the decisive function of perception, and it is "nor non-perception"
because it is present in a subtle form as a residual formation.
55.	And this meaning should be illustrated not only by these similes but by
other appropriate ones as well.
Enters upon and dwells in is already explained.
This is the detailed explanation of the base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception as a meditation subject.
[General]
56.	Thus has the Peerless Helper told
The fourfold immaterial state;
To know these general matters too
Will not be inappropriate.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
The object they are four, the wise
Do not admit surmounting of
Factors that one can recognize.
58.	Of these [four], the first is due to surmounting signs of materiality the
second is due to surmounting space, the third is due to surmounting the
consciousness that occurred with that space as its object, and the fourth is due to
surmounting the disappearance of the consciousness that occurred with that
space as its object. So they should be understood as four in number with the
surmounting of the object in each case. [339] But the wise do not admit any
surmounting of [jhana] factors; for there is no surmounting of factors in them as
there is in the case of the fine-material-sphere attainments. Each one has just the
two factors, namely equanimity and unification of mind.
59.	That being so:
They progress in refinement; each
Is finer than the one before.
Two figures help to make them known;
The cloth lengths, and each palace floor.
60. Suppose there were a four-storied palace: on its first floor the five objects of
sense pleasure were provided in a very fine form as divine dancing, singing and
music, and perfumes, scents, garlands, food, couches, clothing, etc., and on the
second they were finer than that, and on the third finer still, and on the fourth
thev were finest of all; yet they are still only palace floors, and there is no difference
between them in the matter of their state (essence) as palace floors; it is with the
progressive refinement of the five objects of sense pleasure that each one is finer
than the one below;—again suppose there were lengths of cloth of quadruple,
triple, double and single thickness, and [made] of thick, thin, thinner, and very
thin thread spun by one woman, all the same measure in width and breadth;
now although these lengths of cloth are four in number, yet they measure the
same in width and breadth, there is no difference in their measurement; but in
softness to the touch, fineness, and costliness each is finer than the one before;—
so too, although there are only the two factors in all four [immaterial states], that
is to say equanimity and unification of mind, still each one should be understood
as finer than the one before with the progressive refinement of factors due to
successful development.
61. And for the fact that each one of them is finer than the last [there is this
figure:]
One hangs upon a tent that stands
On filth; on him another leans.
Outside a third not leaning stands,
Against the last another leans.
Between the four men and these states
The correspondence then is shown,
And so how each to each relates
Can bv a man of wit be known.
`335
Chapter X
The Immaterial States
62.	This is how the meaning should be construed. There was a tent in a dirty
place, it seems. Then a man arrived, and being disgusted with the dirt, he rested
himself on the tent with his hands and remained as if hung or hanging on to it.
Then another man came and leant upon the man hanging on to the tent. Then
another man came and thought, "The one who is hanging on to the tent and the
one who is leaning upon him are both badly off, and if the tent falls thev will
certainly fall. I think I shall stand outside." [340] So instead of leaning upon the
one leaning upon the first, he remained outside. Then another arrived, and
taking account of the insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one
leaning upon him, and fancying that the one standing outside was well placed,
he stood leaning upon him.
63.	Herein, this is how it should be regarded. The space from which the kasina
has been removed is like the tent in the dirty place. The [consciousness of the]
base consisting of boundless space, which makes space its object owing to
disgust with the sign of the fine-material, is like the man who hangs on to the
tent owing to disgust with the dirt. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of
boundless consciousness, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the
consciousness of] the base consisting of boundless space whose object is space,
is like the man who leans upon the man who hangs on to the tent. The
[consciousness of the] base consisting of nothingness, which instead of making
[the consciousness of the] base consisting of boundless space its object has the
non-existence of that as its object, is like the man who, after considering the
insecurity of those two, does not lean upon the one hanging on to the tent, but
stands outside. The [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception
nor non-perception, the occurrence of which is contingent upon [the
consciousness of] the base consisting of nothingness, which stands in a place
outside, in other words, in the non-existence of [the past] consciousness, is like
the man who stands leaning upon the last-named, having considered the
insecurity of the one hanging on to the tent and the one leaning upon him, and
fancying that the one standing outside is well placed.
64.	And while occurring in this way:
It takes this for its object since
There is no other one as good,
As men depend upon a king,
Whose fault thev see, for livelihood.
65. For although this [consciousness of the] base consisting of neither
perception nor non-perception has seen the flaw in the base consisting of
nothingness in this way, "This attainment has the base consisting of boundless
consciousness as its near enemy/' notwithstanding that fact it takes it as its
object in the absence of any other. Like what? As men for the sake of livelihood
depend on kings whose faults they see. For just as, for the sake of livelihood and
because they cannot get a livelihood elsewhere, people put up with some king,
ruler of all quarters, who is unrestrained, and harsh in bodily, verbal, and mental
behaviour, though they see his faults thus, "He is harshly behaved," so too the
[consciousness of the] base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception
`336
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
takes that base consisting of nothingness as its object in spite of seeing its faults
in this way, and it does so since it cannot find another [better] object.
66.	As one who mounts a lofty stair
Leans on its railings for a prop,
As one who climbs an airy peak
Leans on the mountain's very top,
As one who stands on a crag's edge
Leans for support on his own knees—
Each jhana rests on that below;
For so it is with each of these.

Chapter XI
Concentration—Conclusion:
Nutriment and the Elements
(Samadhi-niddesa)
[Perception of Repulsiveness in Nutriment]
1. [341] Now comes the description of the development of the perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment, which was listed as the "one perception"1 next to
the immaterial states (III.105).
Herein, it nourishes (aharati, lit. "brings on"), thus it is nutriment (ahara, lit.
"bringing on"). That is of four kinds as: physical nutriment, nutriment consisting
of contact, nutriment consisting of mental volition, and nutriment consisting of
consciousness.2
1.	"The word 'perception' (sanna) is used for the dharnma with the characteristic of
perceiving (sanjanana), as in the case of 'perception of visible objects/ 'perception of
sound/ etc.; and it is used for insight, as in the case of 'perception of impermanence/
'perception of suffering/ etc.; and it is used for serenity, as in the passage, 'Perception
of the bloated and perception of visible objects, have these one meaning or different
meanings, Sopaka?' (Source untraced. Cf. III.Ill), and so on. Here, however, it should
be understood as the preliminary work for serenity; for it is the apprehending of the
repulsive aspect in nutriment, or the access jhana produced by means of that, that is
intended here by 'perception of repulsiveness in mitriment"'(Vism-mht 334-35).
2.	A more detailed exposition of nutriment is given at M-a I 107ff. "'It nourishes'
(iaharati)": the meaning is that it leads up, fetches, produces, its own fruit through its
state as a condition for the fruit's arising or presence, which state is called "nutriment
condition." It is made into a mouthful (kabalani karlyati), thus it is physical (kabalinkara).
In this way it gets its designation from the concrete object; but as to characteristic, it
should be understood] to have the characteristic of nutritive essence (oja). It is physical
and it is nutriment in the sense stated, thus it is physical nutriment; so with the rest.
It touches (phusati), thus it is contact (phassa); for although this is an immaterial state,
it occurs also as the aspect of touching on an object (aranmiana—lit. "what is to be
leaned on"), which is why it is said to have the characteristic of touching. It wills
(cetayati), thus it is volition (cetana); the meaning is that it arranges (collects) itself
together with associated states upon the object. Mental volition is volition occupied
with the mind. It cognizes (vijmiati) by conjecturing about rebirth (see XVII.303), thus
it is consciousness (vinnana - cognition) (Vism-mht 335).
`338
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
2. But what is it here that nourishes (brings on) what? Physical nutriment
(kabalinkarahara) nourishes (brings on) the materiality of the octad that has
nutritive essence as eighth:3 contact as nutriment nourishes (brings on) the
three kinds of feeling; mental volition as nutriment nourishes (brings on) rebirth-
linking in the three kinds of becoming; consciousness as nutriment nourishes
(brings on) mentality-materiality at the moment of rebirth-linking.
3. Now, when there is physical nutriment there is attachment, which brings
peril; when there is nutriment as contact there is approaching, which brings
peril; when there is nutriment as mental volition there is rebirth-linking, which
brings peril.4 And to show how they bring fear thus, physical nutriment should
be illustrated by the simile of the child's flesh (S II 98), contact as nutriment by
the simile of the hideless cow (S II 99), mental volition as nutriment by the simile
of the pit of live coals (S II 99), and consciousness as nutriment by the simile of
the hundred spears (S II 100).
4. But of these four kinds of nutriment it is only physical nutriment, classed as
what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is intended here as "nutriment"
in this sense. The perception arisen as the apprehension of the repulsive aspect
in that nutriment is, "perception of repulsiveness in nutriment."
--
3.	For the "octad with nutritive essence as eighth" (ojatthamaka), see XVIII.5ff. and
XX.27ff.
4.	Vism-mht (p. 355) explains attachment here as craving which is "perilous because
it brings harm" (see e.g. D II 58-59), or in other words, "greed for the five aggregates
(lust after five-aggregate experience)." It cites the following: "Bhikkhus, when there is
physical nutriment, there is greed (lust), there is delighting, there is craving;
consciousness being planted therein grows. Wherever consciousness being planted
grows, there is the combination of mind-and-matter. Wherever there is the combination
of mind-and-matter, there is ramification of formations. Wherever there is ramification
of formations, there is production of further becoming in the future. Wherever there
is production of further becoming in the future, there is future birth, aging and death.
Wherever there is future birth, aging and death, bhikkhus, the end is sorrow, I say
with woe and despair" (S II 101; cf. S II 66). Approaching is explained as "meeting,
coinciding, with unabandoned perversions [of perception] due to an object [being
perceived as permanent, etc., when it is not]." That is, "perilous since it is not free
from the three kinds of suffering." The quotation given is: "Bhikkhus, due to contact
of the kind to be felt as pleasant, pleasant feeling arises. With that feeling as condition
there is craving, ... thus there is the arising of this whole mass of suffering" (cf. S IV
215). Reappearance is "rebirth in some kind of becoming or other. Being flung into a
new becoming is perilous because there is no immunity from the risks rooted in
reappearance." The following is quoted: "Not knowing, bhikkhus, a man forms the
formation of merit, and his [rebirth] consciousness accords with the merit [tie
performed]; he forms the formation of demerit; ... he forms the formation of the
imperturbable ..." (SII82). Rebirth-linking is the actual linking with the next becoming,
which "is perilous since it is not immune from the suffering due to the signs of [the
impending] rebirth-linking." The quotation given is: "Bhikkhus, when there is
consciousness as nutriment there is greed (lust), there is delighting ..." (S II 102—
complete as above).
`339
Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
5.	One who wants to develop that perception of repulsiveness in nutriment
should learn the meditation subject and see that he has no uncertainty about
even a single word of what he has learnt. Then he should go into solitary retreat
and [342] review repulsiveness in ten aspects in the physical nutriment classified
as what is eaten, drunk, chewed, and tasted, that is to say, as to going, seeking,
using, secretion, receptacle, what is uncooked (undigested), what is cooked
(digested), fruit, outflow, and smearing.
6.	1. Herein, as to going: even when a man has gone forth in so mighty a
dispensation, still after he has perhaps spent all night reciting the Enlightened
One's word or doing the ascetic's work, after he has risen early to do the duties
connected with the shrine terrace and the Enlightenment-tree terrace, to set out
the water for drinking and washing, to sweep the grounds and to see to the
needs of the body after he has sat down on his seat and given attention to his
meditation subject twenty or thirty times5 and got up again, then he must take
his bowl and [outer] robe, he must leave behind the ascetics' woods that are not
crowded with people, offer the bliss of seclusion, possess shade and water, and
are clean, cool, delightful places, he must disregard the Noble Ones' delight in
seclusion, and he must set out for the village in order to get nutriment, as a
jackal for the charnel ground.
7. And as he goes thus, from the time when he steps down from his bed or
chair he has to tread on a carpet6 covered with the dust of his feet, geckos'
droppings, and so on. Next he has to see the doorstep,7 which is more repulsive
than the inside of the room since it is often fouled with the droppings of rats,
bats,8 and so on. Next the lower terrace, which is more repulsive than the terrace
above since it is all smeared with the droppings of owls, pigeons,9 and so on.
Next the grounds,10 which are more repulsive than the lower floor since they are
defiled by old grass and leaves blown about by the wind, by sick novices' urine,
excrement, spittle and snot, and in the rainy season by water, mud, and so on.
And he has to see the road to the monastery which is more repulsive than the
grounds.
--
5. Twenty or thirty times': here some say that the definition of the number of times
is according to what is present-by-continuity (see XIV188). But others say that it is by
way of "warming up the seat" (see M-a I 255); for development that has not reached
suppression of hindrances does not remove the bodily discomfort in the act of sitting,
because of the lack of pervading happiness. So there is inconstancy of posture too.
Then 'twenty or thirty' is taken as the number already observed by the time of setting
out on the alms round. Or alternatively from 'going' up to 'smearing' is one turn; then
it is after giving attention to the meditation subject by twenty or thirty turns in this
way" (Vism-mht 339).
6.	Paccattharana—"carpet": the word normally means a coverlet, but here, according
to Vism-mht, (p. 339) it is, "a spread (attharana) consisting of a rug (ciliniika) to be
spread on the ground for protecting the skin."
7.	For pamukha—"doorstep," perhaps an open upper floor gallery here, see XIII.6.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
8.	In due course, after standing in the debating lodge11 when he has finished
paying homage at the Enlightenment Tree and the shrine, he sets out thinking,
"Instead of looking at the shrine that is like a cluster of pearls, and the
Enlightenment Tree that is as lovely as a bouquet of peacock's tail feathers, and
the abode that is as fair as a god's palace, I must now turn my back on such a
charming place and go abroad for the sake of food;" and on the wav to the
village, the view of a road of stumps and thorns and an uneven road broken up
by the force of water awaits him.
9.	Next, after he has put on his waist cloth as one who hides an abscess, and
tied his waist band as one who ties a bandage on a wound, and robed himself in
his upper robes as one who hides a skeleton, and taken out his bowl as one who
takes out a pan for medicine, [343] when he reaches the vicinity of the village
gate, perhaps the sight of an elephant's carcass, a horse's carcass, a buffalo's
carcass, a human carcass, a snake's carcass, or a dog's carcass awaits him, and
not only that, but he has to suffer his nose to be assailed by the smell of them.
Next, as he stands in the village gateway, he must scan the village streets in
order to avoid danger from savage elephants, horses, and so on.
10.	So this repulsive [experience] beginning with the carpet that has to be
trodden on and ending with the various kinds of carcasses that have to be seen
and smelled, [has to be undergone] for the sake of nutriment: "Oh, nutriment is
indeed a repulsive thing!"
This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to going.
11.	2. How as to seeking? When he has endured the repulsiveness of going in
this way and has gone into the village, and is clothed in his cloak of patches, he
has to wander in the village streets from house to house like a beggar with a
dish in his hand. And in the rainy season wherever he treads his feet sink into
water and mire up to the flesh of the calves.12 He has to hold the bowl in one hand
and his robe up with the other. In the hot season he has to go about with his
body covered with the dirt, grass, and dust blown about by the wind. On reaching
such and such a house door he has to see and even to tread in gutters and
cesspools covered with blue-bottles and seething with all the species of worms,
all mixed up with fish washings, meat washings, rice washings, spittle, snot,
dogs' and pigs' excrement, and what not, from which flies come up and settle
on his outer cloak of patches and on his bowl and on his head.
12.	And when he enters a house, some give and some do not. And when they
give, some give yesterday's cooked rice and stale cakes and rancid jelly sauce
and so on.13 Some, not giving, say "Please pass on, venerable sir," others keep
--
11.	Vitakka-malcika—"debating lodge": Vism-mht (p. 339) says: "'Kattlia mi kho ajja
bhikkliaya caritabban ti adina vitakkmnalake" ("in a lodge for thinking in the wav beginning
'Where must I go for alms today?"').
12.	Pindika-immsa—"flesh of the calves" = jaiigluipindikammusapadesa. (Vism-mht 340)

it as made of com (yava).

silent as if they did not see him. Some avert their faces. Others treat him with
harsh words such as: "Go away you bald-head." When he has wandered for
alms in the village in this way like a beggar, he has to depart from it.
13.	So this [experience] beginning with the entrv into the village and ending
with the departure from it, which is repulsive owing to the water, mud, etc., that
has to be trodden in and seen and endured, [has to be undergone] for the sake of
nutriment: "Oh, nutriment is indeed a repulsive thing!"
This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to seeking. [344]
14.	3. How as to using? After he has sought the nutriment in this way and is
sitting at ease in a comfortable place outside the village, then so long as he has
not dipped his hand into it he would be able to invite a respected bliikkhu or a
decent person, if he saw one, [to share it]; but as soon as he has dipped his hand
into it out of desire to eat he would be ashamed to say "Take some." And when
he has dipped his hand in and is squeezing it up, the sweat trickling down his
five fingers wets any dry crisp food there may be and makes it sodden.
15.	And when its good appearance has been spoilt by his squeezing it up, and
it has been made into a ball and put into his mouth, then the lower teeth function
as a mortar, the upper teeth as a pestle, and the tongue as a hand. It gets pounded
there with the pestle of the teeth like a dog's dinner in a dog's trough, while he
turns it over and over with his tongue; then the thin spittle at the tip of the tongue
smears it, and the thick spittle behind the middle of the tongue smears it, and
the filth from the teeth in the parts where a tooth-stick cannot reach smears it.
16.	When thus mashed up and besmeared, this peculiar compound now
destitute of the [original] colour and smell is reduced to a condition as utterly
nauseating as a dog's vomit in a dog's trough. Yet, notwithstanding that it is
like this, it can still be swallowed because it is no longer in range of the eye's
focus.
This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to using.
17.	4. How as to secretion? Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas and Wheel-turning
Monarchs have only one of the four secretions consisting of bile, phlegm, pus
7--a	I	O ' I
and blood, but those with weak merit have all four. So when [the food] has
arrived at the stage of being eaten and it enters inside, then in one whose secretion
of bile is in excess it becomes as utterly nauseating as if smeared with thick
madhuka oil; in one whose secretion of phlegm in excess it is as if smeared with
the juice of nagabala leaves;14 in one whose secretion of pus is in excess it is as if
smeared with rancid buttermilk; and in one whose secretion of blood is in excess
it is as utterly nauseating as if smeared with dye. This is how repulsiveness
should be reviewed as to secretion.
18. 5. How as to receptacle? When it has gone inside the belly and is smeared
with one of these secretions, then the receptacle it goes into is no gold dish or
crystal or silver dish and so on. On the contrary if it is swallowed by one ten
years old, it finds itself in a place like a cesspit unwashed for ten years. [345] If it
is swallowed by one twenty years old, thirty forty, fifty sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
years old, if it is swallowed by one a hundred years old, it finds itself in a place
like a cesspit unwashed for a hundred years. This is how repulsiveness should
be reviewed as to receptacle.
19. 6. How as to wluit is uncooked (undigested)? After this nutriment has arrived
at such a place for its receptacle, then for as long as it remains uncooked it stays
in that same place just described, which is shrouded in absolute darkness,
pervaded by draughts,15 tainted by various smells of ordure and utterly fetid
and loathsome. And just as when a cloud out of season has rained during a
drought and bits of grass and leaves an|d rushes and the carcasses of snakes,
dogs and human beings that have collected in a pit at the gate of an outcaste
village remain there warmed by the sun's heat until the pit becomes covered
with froth and bubbles, so too, what has been swallowed that day and yesterday
and the day before remains there together, and being smothered by the layer of
phlegm and covered with froth and bubbles produced by digestion through
being fermented by the heat of the bodily fires, it becomes quite loathsome. This
is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is uncooked.
20.	7. How as to what is cooked? When it has been completely cooked there by
the bodily fires, it does not turn into gold, silver, etc., as the ores16 of gold, silver,
etc., do [through smelting]. Instead, giving off froth and bubbles, it turns into
excrement and fills the receptacle for digested food, like brown clay squeezed
with a smoothing trowel and packed into a tube, and it turns into urine and fills
the bladder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to what is cooked.
21.	8. How as to fruit? When it has been rightly cooked, it produces the various
kinds of ordure consisting of head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, and the rest.
When wrongly cooked it produces the hundred diseases beginning with itch,
ring-worm, smallpox, leprosy, plague, consumption, coughs, flux, and so on.
Such is its fruit. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to fruit.
22.	9. How as to outflow? On being swallowed, it enters by one door, after which
it flows out by several doors in the way beginning, "Eye-dirt from the eye, ear-
dirt from the ear" (Sn 197). And on being swallowed it is swallowed even in the
company of large gatherings. But on flowing out, now converted into excrement,
urine, etc., it is excreted only in solitude. [346] On the first day one is delighted
to eat it, elated and full of happiness and joy. On the second day one stops one's
nose to void it, with a wry face, disgusted and dismayed. And on the first day
one swallows it lustfully greedily gluttonously infatuatedly. But on the second
day, after a single night has passed, one excretes it with distaste, ashamed,
humiliated and disgusted. Hence the Ancients said:
23.	The food and drink so greatly prized—
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—
Go in all by a single door,
But by nine doors come oozing out.

Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
The food and drink so greatly prized—
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—
Men like to eat in company,
But to excrete in secrecy.
The food and drink so greatly prized—
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—
These a man eats with high delight,
And then excretes with dumb disgust.
The food and drink so greatly prized—
The crisp to chew, the soft to suck—
A single night will be enough
To bring them to putridity
This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed as to outflow.
24. 10. How as to smearing? At the time of using it he smears his hands, lips,
tongue and palate, and they become repulsive by being smeared with it. And
even when washed, they have to be washed again and again in order to remove
the smell. And, just as, when rice is being boiled, the husks, the red powder
covering the grain, etc., rise up and smear the mouth, rim and lid of the cauldron,
so too, when eaten it rises up during its cooking and simmering by the bodily
fire that pervades the whole body it turns into tartar, which smears the teeth, and
it turns into spittle, phlegm, etc., which respectively smear the tongue, palate,
etc.; and it turns into eye-dirt, ear-dirt, snot, urine, excrement, etc., which
respectively smear the eyes, ears, nose and nether passages. And when these
doors are smeared by it, they never become either clean or pleasing even though
washed every day And after one has washed a certain one of these, the hand has
to be washed again.17 And after one has washed a certain one of these, the
repulsiveness does not depart from it even after two or three washings with cow
dung and clay and scented powder. This is how repulsiveness should be reviewed
as to smearing.
25. As he reviews repulsiveness in this way in ten aspects and strikes at it with
thought and applied thought, physical nutriment [347] becomes evident to him
in its repulsive aspect. He cultivates that sign18 again and again, develops and
17.	"'A certain one' is said with reference to the anal orifice. But those who are
scrupulously clean by nature wash their hands again after washing the mouth, and so
on" (Vism-mht 342).
18.	"'That sign': that object as the sign for development, which sign is called physical
nutriment and has appeared in the repulsive aspect to one who gives his attention to
it repeatedly in the ways already described. And there, while development occurs
through the repulsive aspect, it is only the dhammas on account of which there comes
to be the concept of physical nutriment that are repulsive, not the concept. But it is
because the occurrence of development is contingent only upon dhammas with an
individual essence, and because the profundity is due to that actual individual essence
of dhammas that have individual essences, that the jhana cannot reach absorption in it
through apprehension of the repulsive aspect. For it is owing to profundity that the
first pair of truths is hard to see" (Vism-mht 342-43).
`344
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
repeatedly practices it. As he does so, the hindrances are suppressed, and his
mind is concentrated in access concentration, but without reaching absorption
because of the profundity of physical nutriment as a state with an individual
essence. But perception is evident here in the apprehension of the repulsive
aspect, which is why this meditation subject goes by the name of "perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment."
26. When a bhikkhu devotes himself to this perception of repulsiveness in
nutriment, his mind retreats, retracts and recoils from craving for flavours. He
nourishes himself with nutriment without vanity and only for the purpose of
crossing over suffering, as one who seeks to cross over the desert eats his own
dead child's flesh (S II 98). Then his greed for the five cords of sense desire
comes to be fully understood without difficulty by means of the full
understanding of the physical nutriment. He fully understands the materiality
aggregate by means of the full-understanding of the five cords of sense desire.
Development of mindfulness occupied with the body comes to perfection in him
through the repulsiveness of "what is uncooked" and the rest. He has entered
upon a way that is in conformity with the perception of foulness. And by keeping
to this way, even if he does not experience the deathless goal in this life, he is at
least bound for a happy destiny.
This is the detailed explanation of the development of the perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment.
[Defining of The Elements: Word Definitions]
27. Now comes the description of the development of the definition of the four
elements, which was listed as the "one defining" next to the perception of
repulsiveness in nutriment (III.105).
Herein, "defining" (vavatthana) is determining by characterizing individual
essences.19 [The compound] catudhatuvavatthana ("four-element defining") is
[resolvable into] catunnam dhatunam vavatthanam ("defining of the four elements").
"Attention given to elements," "the meditation subject consisting of elements"
and "defining of the four elements" all mean the same thing.
This is given in two ways: in brief and in detail. It is given in brief in the
Mahasatipatthana Sutta (D II 294), and in detail in the Mahahatthipadopama
Sutta (M I 185), the Rahulovada Sutta (M I 421), and the Dhatuvibhanga Sutta
(M III 240).
--
19. "'By characterizing individual essences': by making certain (upadharana) of the specific
characteristics of hardness, and so on. For this meditation subject does not consist in
the observing of a mere concept, as in the case of the earth kasina as a meditation
subject, neither does it consist in the observing of the colour blue, etc., as in the case
of the blue kasina as a meditation subject, nor in the observing of the general
characteristics of impermanence, etc., in formations, as in the case of insight as a
meditation subject; but rather it consists in the observing of the individual essences of
earth, and so on. That is why 'by characterizing individual essences' is said, which
means, 'by making certain of the specific characteristics of hardness, and so on"(Vism-
mht 344).
`345
Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
[Texts and Commentary in Brief]
28.	It is given in brief in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, for one of quick
understanding whose meditation subject is elements, as follows: "Bhikkhus,
just as though a skilled butcher or butcher's apprentice had killed a cow and
were seated at the crossroads [348] with it cut up into pieces, so too, bhikkhus, a
bhikkhu reviews this body however placed, however disposed, as consisting of
elements: In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element"20 (D II 294).
29.	The meaning is this: just as though a clever butcher, or his apprentice who
worked for his keep, had killed a cow and divided it up and were seated at the
crossroads, reckoned as the intersection of the main roads going in the four
directions, having laid it out part by part, so too a bhikkhu reviews the body, however
placed because it is in some one of the four postures and however disposed because
it is so placed, thus: In this body there are the earth element, the water element, the fire
element, and the air element.
30. What is meant? Just as the butcher, while feeding the cow, bringing it to the
shambles, keeping it tied up after bringing it there, slaughtering it, and seeing it
slaughtered and dead, does not lose the perception "cow" so long as he has not
carved it up and divided it into parts; but when he has divided it up and is
sitting there, he loses the perception "cow" and the perception "meat" occurs;
he does not think "I am selling cow" or "Tliev are carrying cow away" but rather
he thinks "I am selling meat" or "They are carrying meat away"; so too this
bhikkhu, while still a foolish ordinary person—both formerly as a layman and
as one gone forth into homelessness—does not lose the perception "living being"
or "man" or "person" so long as he does not, by resolution of the compact into
elements, review this body however placed, however disposed, as consisting of
elements. But when he does review it as consisting of elements, he loses the
perception "living being" and his mind establishes itself upon elements. That is
why the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, just as though a skilled butcher ... were
seated at the crossroads ... so too, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu ... air element."
--
20. "Herein, as regards 'earth element/ etc., the meaning of element is the meaning of
individual essence, the meaning of individual essence is the meaning of voidness, the
meaning of voidness is the meaning of not-a-living-being. So it is just earth in the
sense of individual essence, voidness and not-a-living-being that is the element; hence
it is earth element; so too in the case of the water element, and the rest. The earth
element is the element that is the foothold for the conascent material states. Likewise
the water element is the element of their cohesion; the fire element is the element of
their ripening; and the air element is the element of their conveyance and distension"
(Vism-mht 345).
To avoid confusion, it might be mentioned here that in "physical" earth, fire, water,
and air, it would be held that all four elements are present in each equally but that in
"physical" earth the earth element is dominant in efficacy as the mode of hardness;
and correspondingly with water and the rest. See e.g. XIV45.
`346
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
[In Detail]
31. In the Mahahatthipadopama Sutta it is given in detail for one of not over-
quick understanding whose meditation subject is elements—and as here so
also in the Rahulovada and Dhatuvibhanga Suttas—as follows:
"And what is the internal earth element, friends? Whatever there is internally
in oneself that is hard, harsh,21 and clung to (acquired through kamma), that is
to say, head hairs, body hairs, teeth, nails, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow,
kidney, heart, liver, midriff, spleen, lungs, bowels, entrails, gorge, dung, or
whatever else there is internally in oneself that is hard, harsh, and clung to—
this is called the internal earth element" (M I 185). [349]
And: "What is the internal water element, friends? Whatever there is internally
in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to, that is to say bile, phlegm, pus,
blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine, or whatever
else there is internally in oneself that is water, watery, and clung to—this is
called the internal water element" (M I 187).
And: "What is the internal fire element, friends? Whatever there is internally
in oneself that is fire, fiery and clung to, that is to say that whereby one is warmed,
ages, and burns up, and whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted gets
completely digested, or whatever else there is internally in oneself that is fire,
fiery, and clung to—this is called the internal fire element" (M I 188).
And: "What is the internal air element, friends? Whatever there is internally
in oneself that is air, airy and clung to, that is to say up-going winds, down-
going winds, winds in the belly winds in the bowels, winds that course through
all the limbs, in-breath and out-breath, or whatever else there is internally in oneself
that is air, airy and clung to—this is called the internal air element" (M I 188).
32. Here is the commentary on the words that are not clear. Internally in oneself
(ajjlrattam paccattam): both these words are terms for what is one's own (niyaka), since
what is one's own is what is produced in one's own self (attani jatam); the meaning
is, included in one's continuity (sasantati-pariyapanna). This is called "internal"
(ajjhanam = adhi + atta, lit. "belonging-to-self") because it occurs in self (attani—
locative case) just as in the world, speech among women (itthlsu—loc. case) is called
"[speech] belonging-to-women" (adhitthi). And it is called, "in oneself" (paccattam)
because it occurs owing to self (attanam paticca).22
33.	Hard: rigid. Harsh: rough. Herein, the first is a word for the characteristic, while
the second is a word for the mode; for the earth element is characterized as hard, but
its mode is rough, which is wlw it is called "harsh." Clung to: taken firmly [bv
kamma]; the meaning is, firmly taken, seized, adhered to, as "I," "mine" (see §89f.).
34.	That is to say: the word seyyathidam ("that is to say") is a particle; its meaning
is, "What is that?" Next, showing what that is, "head hairs, body hairs," etc., is
--
21.	Kliarigata—"harsh": not in PED, but see khara.
22.	"What occurs in attendance (adliikicca) upon self (atta) by its pertaining to the
state that may be taken as self because it is included in one's own continuity as
internal (ajjhatta)" (Vism-mht 347).

Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
said. And here the brain must be added since it has to be understood that the
earth element needs to be described in twenty modes. Or whatever else: the earth
element included in the remaining three portions.
35.	[350] It flows (iappoti), flows on (pappoti), to such and such a place as a state
of streaming, thus it is water (apo). The watery (apo-gata) is what is gone (gata)
among such various kinds of water (apo) as the kamma-originated, and so on.
What is that? It is what has the water element's characteristic of cohesion.
36.	Fire (tejo) [is definable] as heating (tejana). The fiery (tejo-gata) is what is
gone {gata), in the wav already described, among the kinds of fire (tejo). What is
that? It is what has the characteristic of heat. Whereby: by means of which the fire
element, when excited, this body is warmed, becomes heated by the state of one-
day fever,23 and so on. Ages: whereby this body grows old, reaches the decline of
the faculties, loss of strength, wrinkles, grayness, and so on. Burns up: whereby,
when excited, it causes this body to burn, and the person cries out, "I am burning,
I am burning!" and longs for ghee a hundred times washed and for goslsa
sandalwood ointment, etc., and for the breeze of a fan. And whereby what is eaten,
drunk, chewed and tasted gets completely digested: whereby the boiled rice, etc., that
is eaten, or the beverage, etc., that is drunk, or the hard food consisting of flour
biscuits, etc., that is chewed, the mango fruit, honey molasses, etc., that is tasted, gets
completely cooked; gets its juice, etc., extracted, is the meaning. And here the first
three kinds of fire element [that is to say "is warmed," "ages," and "bums up"] are
of fourfold origination (XX.27ff.), while the last is only kamma-originated.
37. Air (vayo) [is definable] as blowing (vayana). The airy (vayo-gata) is what is
gone {gata), in the wav already described, among the kinds of air. What is that? It
is what has the characteristic of distension.24 Up going winds: winds (forces)
mounting upwards that cause the occurrence of vomiting, belching, and so on.
Down-going winds: winds (forces) descending downwards that expel excrement
and urine. Winds in the belly: winds (forces) outside the bowels. Winds in the
bowels: winds (forces) inside the bowels. Winds that course through all the limbs:
winds (forces) that produce flexing, extending, etc., and are distributed over the
limbs and the whole body by means of the network of veins (nerves). In-breath:
wind in the nostrils entering in. Out-breath: wind in the nostrils issuing out.
And here the first five are of fourfold origination. In-breath and out-breath are
consciousness-originated. [351]
--
23.	Jam—"fever": not in PED; see A V 100; Nidd 117.
24.	Vittliambhana—"distension": the word most usually employed to describe the air
element. It is often rendered by "supporting," a word earmarked here for nissaya. The
twofold function of the air element is (a) to uphold (sandharana) by distending
(vitthambhana) and preventing collapse (§92), and (b) to move (samudirana), or more
strictly cause the appearance of motion (calami, see n. 37). In XIV61 it is said to cause
thambhana, rendered by "stiffening"; but there is the description of the earth element
as tliaddha (e.g. §39; pp. of thambliati, from which the noun tliambliana comes), rendered
by "stiffenedness." It may also be noted that the word sandharam (upholding) is used
to describe both the earth element (XIV47) and the air element (XIV61).
`348
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
In each instance the phrase or whatever else comprises respectively the water
element, the fire element, or the air element included in the other three portions.
38.	So the four elements have been detailed in for tv-two aspects, that is to say,
the earth element in twenty aspects, the water element in twelve, the fire element
in four, and the air element in six.
This, firstly is the commentary on the texts here.
[Method of Development in Brief]
39.	As regards the method of development here, however, to discern the elements
in detail in this way, "The head hairs are the earth element, the body hairs are the
earth element," appears redundant to a bhikkhu of quick understanding, though
the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives his attention to it in this
way: "What has the characteristic of stiffenedness is the earth element, what has
the characteristic of cohesion is the water element, what has the characteristic of
ripening (maturing) is the fire element, what has the characteristic of distending
(supporting) is the air element." But when one of not over-quick understanding
gives his attention to it in this way it appears obscure and unevident, and it only
becomes plain to him if he gives his attention to it in the first-mentioned way Why?
40. Suppose two bhikkhus are reciting a text with many elided repetitions, then
the bhikkhu with the quicker understanding fills out the elided repetitions once
or twice, after which he goes on doing the recital with only the two end parts of
the elisions. Here the one of less quick understanding says, "What is he reciting?
Whv, he does not even give one time to move one's lips! If the recitation is done
like this, when shall we ever get familiar with the text?" and so he does his
recitation filling out each elision as it comes. Then the other says, "What is he
reciting? Whv, he never lets one get to the end of it! If the recitation is done like
this; when shall we ever get to the end of it?" So too, the detailed discerning of
the elements by head hairs, etc., appears redundant to one of quick
understanding, though the meditation subject becomes clear to him if he gives
his attention to it in brief in this way "What has the characteristic of stiffenedness
is the earth element," and so on. But when the other gives his attention to it in
'	o
this wav, it appears obscure and unevident, and it only becomes plain to him if
he gives his attention in detail by head hairs and so on.
41.	So firstly one of quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation
subject should go into solitary retreat. Then he should advert to his own entire
material body and discern the elements in brief in this way: "In this body what
is stiffenedness or harshness is the earth element, what is cohesion or fluidity25
[352] is the water element, what is maturing (ripening) or heat is the fire element,
what is distension or movement is the air element." And he should advert and
give attention to it and review it again and again as "earth element, water
element," that is to say as mere elements, not a living being, and soulless.
42.	As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in
him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of
--
25. Drava-bhava—"fluidity": not in PED.
`349
Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it
has states with individual essences as its object.
43.	Or alternatively there are these four [bodily] parts mentioned by the General
of the Dhamma [the Elder Sariputta] for the purpose of showing the absence of
any living being in the four great primary elements thus: "When a space is
enclosed with bones and sinews and flesh and skin, there comes to be the term
'material form' (riipa)" (M I 190). And he should resolve each of these [as a
separate entity], separating them out by the hand of knowledge, and then discern
them in the way already stated thus: "In these what is stiffenedness or harshness
is the earth element." And he should again and again advert to them, give
attention to them and review them as mere elements, not a living being, not a
soul.
44.	As he makes effort in this way it is not long before concentration arises in
him, which is reinforced by understanding that illuminates the classification of
the elements, and which is only access and does not reach absorption because it
has states with individual essences as its object.
This is the method of development when the definition of the elements is
given in brief.
[Method of Development in Detail]
45.	The method given in detail should be understood in this way A meditator
of not over-quick understanding who wants to develop this meditation subject
should learn the elements in detail in the forty-two aspects from a teacher, and
he should live in an abode of the kind already described. Then, when he has
done all the duties, he should go into solitary retreat and develop the meditation
subject in four wavs thus: (1) with constituents in brief, (2) with constituents by
analysis, (3) with characteristics in brief, and (4) with characteristics bv analvsis.
[(1) With Constituents in Brief]
46.	Herein, how does he develop it with constituents in brief? Here a bhikkhu
does his defining in this way, "In twenty of the parts what has the stiffened mode
-------“----^...........V---------_------I------- -----------~--------------------------
is the earth element," and he does his defining thus, "In twelve parts the liquid
called water with the mode of cohesion is the water element," [353] and he does
his defining thus, "In four parts what matures (what has the mode of ripening)
is the fire element," and he does his defining thus, "In six parts what has the
mode of distending is the air element." As he defines them in this way they
become evident to him. As he again and again adverts to them and gives his
attention to them, concentration arises as access only
[(2) With Constituents by Analysis]
47. However, if his meditation subject is not successful while he develops it in
this way, then he should develop it with constituents by analysis. How? Firstly the
bhikkhu should carry out all the directions given for the thirty-two-fold aspect
in the description of mindfulness occupied with the body as a meditation subject
(VIII.48-78), namely the sevenfold skill in learning and the tenfold skill in giving
`350
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
attention, and he should start with the verbal recitation, in direct and reverse
order, of the skin pentad and so on, without omitting anv of it. The only difference
is this: there, after giving attention to the head hairs, etc., as to colour, shape,
direction, location, and delimitation, the mind had to be fixed by means of
repulsiveness (VIII.83), but here it is done by means of elements. Therefore at the
end of each part after giving attention to head hairs, etc., each in the five ways
beginning with colour (VIII.83), attention should be given as follows.
48. These things called head hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the
skull. Herein, just as when kuntha grasses grow on the top of an anthill, the top
of the termite-mound does not know, "Kuntha grasses are growing on me," nor
do the kuntha grasses know, "We are growing on the top of a termite-mound," so
too, the inner skin that covers the skull does not know, "Head hairs grow on me,"
nor do the head hairs know, "We grow on inner skin that envelops a skull."
These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called
head hairs are a particular component of this body without thought, [morally]
indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid (stiffened) earth element.
49.	Body hairs grow on the inner skin that envelops the body. Herein, just as,
when dabba grasses grow on the square in an empty village, the square in the
empty village does not know, "Dabba grasses grow on me," nor do the dabba
grasses know, "We grow on the square in an empty village," so too, the inner
skin that envelops the body does not know, "Body hairs grow on me," nor do the
body hairs know, "We grow on inner skin that envelops a body" These things
are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are called body hairs are a
particular component of this body without thought, indeterminate, void, not a
living being, rigid earth element.
50.	Nails grow on the tips of the fingers and toes. Herein, just as, when children
play a game bv piercing madhuka-iruit kernels with sticks, the sticks [354] do
not know, "Madhuka-iruit kernels are put on us," nor do the madhuka-iruit kernels
know, "We are put on sticks," so too, the fingers and toes do not know, "Nails
grow on our tips," nor do the nails know, "We grow on the tips of fingers and
toes." These things are devoid of mutual concern and reviewing. So what are
called nails are a particular component of this body, without thought,
indeterminate, void, not a living being, rigid earth element.
51.	Teeth grow in the jaw bones. Herein, just as, when posts are placed by
builders in stone sockets and fastened with some kind of cement,26 the sockets
do not know, "Posts are placed in us," nor do the posts know, "We are placed in
sockets," so too, the jaw bones do not know, "Teeth grow in us," nor do the teeth
know, "We grow in jaw bones'." These things are devoid of mutual concern and

81.	When he has given his attention in this way to the body hairs, etc., he should
then give his attention to the [four] fire components thus: That whereby one is warmed—
this is a particular component of this body without thought, indeterminate, void,
not a living being; it is fire element in the mode of maturing (ripening).
That whereby one ages ...
That whereby one burns up ...
That whereby what is eaten, drunk, chewed and tasted becomes completely digested—
this is a particular component of this body without thought, indeterminate,
void, not a living being; it is fire element in the mode of maturing (ripening).
82. After that, having discovered the up-going winds (forces) as upgoing, the
down-going winds (forces) as down-going, the winds (forces) in the belly as in the
belly, the winds (forces) in the bowels as in the bowels, the winds (forces) that course
through all the limbs as coursing through all the limbs, and in-breath and out-
breath as in-breath and out-breath, he should give his attention to these [six] air
components in this way: What is called up-going winds (forces) is a particular
component of this body, without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being;
it is air element in the mode of distending.
What is called down-going winds (forces) ...
What is called winds (forces) in the belly ...
What is called winds (forces) in the bowels ...
What is called winds (forces) that course through all the limbs ...
What is called in-breath and out-breath is a particular component of this body,
without thought, indeterminate, void, not a living being; it is air element in the
mode of distending.
83.	As he gives his attention in this way the elements become evident to him.
As he adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration
arises in him in the way already described.
[(3) With Characteristics in Brief]
84.	But if his meditation subject is still not successful when he gives his attention
to it in this way then he should develop it with characteristics in brief. How? hi the
twenty components the characteristic of stiffenedness should be defined as the earth
element, and the characteristic of cohesion, which is there too, as the water element,
and the characteristic of maturing (ripening), which is there too, as the fire element,
and the characteristic of distension, which is there too, as the air element. In the
twelve components the characteristic of cohesion should be defined as the water
`358

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
element, the characteristic of maturing (ripening), which is there too, as the fire
element, the characteristic of distension, which is there too, as the air element, and
the characteristic of stiffenedness, which is there too, as the earth element, hi the four
components the characteristic of maturing (ripening) should be defined as the fire
element, the characteristic of distension miresolvable (inseparable) from it as the air
element, [364] the characteristic of stiffenedness as the earth element, and the
characteristic of cohesion as the water element. In the six components the characteristic
of distension should be defined as the air element, the characteristic of stiffenedness
there too as the earth element, the characteristic of cohesion as the water element,
and the characteristic of maturing (ripening) as the fire element.
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him. As he
adverts to them and gives attention to them again and again access concentration
arises in him in the way already stated.
[(4) With Characteristics by Analysis]
85.	However, if he still does not succeed with his meditation subject when he
gives his attention to it in this way, then he should develop it with characteristics
by analysis. How? After discerning head hairs, etc., in the wav already described,
the characteristic of stiffenedness in head hairs should be defined as the earth
element, the characteristic of cohesion there too as the water element, the
characteristic of maturing (ripening) as the fire element, and the characteristic
of distension as the air element. The four elements should be defined in this way
in the case of each component.
As he defines them in this way the elements become evident to him. As he
adverts and gives attention to them again and again access concentration arises
in him in the way already described.
[Additional Ways of Giving Attention]
86.	In addition, attention should be given to the elements in the following ways:
(1) as to word meaning, (2) by groups, (3) by particles, (4) by characteristic, etc., (5) as
to how originated, (6) as to variety and unity (7) as to resolution (separability) and
non-resolution (inseparability), (8) as to the similar and the dissimilar, (9) as to
distinction between internal and external, (10) as to inclusion, (11) as to condition,
(12) as to lack of conscious reaction, (13) as to analysis of conditions.
87. 2. Herein, one who gives his attention to them as to word meaning should do
so separately and generally thus: [separately] it is earth (pathavi) because it is
spread out (patthata); it flows (appoti) or it glides (apiyati) or it satisfies (appayati),
thus it is water (apo); it heats (tejati), thus it is fire (tejo); it blows (vayati), thus it is
air (vayo). But without differentiation they are elements (dhatu) because of bearing
(dharana) their own characteristics, because of grasping (adana) suffering, and
because of sorting out (adhana) suffering (see XV19).29 This is how they should
be given attention as to word meaning.
29. "'Because of bearing their own characteristics': these are not like the Primordial
Essence (pakati—Skr. prakrti) and the self (atta) imagined by the theorists which are

Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
88. 2. By groups: there is the earth element described under the twenty aspects
(modes) beginning with head hairs, body hairs, and also the water element
described under the twelve (modes) aspects beginning with bile, phlegm, etc.
Now, as to these:
Colour, odour, taste, and nutritive
Essence, and the four elements—
From combination of these eight
There comes the common usage head hairs;
And separately from these eight30
There is no common usage head hairs.
Consequently, head hairs are only a mere group of eight states. Likewise,
body hairs, [365] and the rest. A component here that is kamma-originated is a
group of ten states, [that is to say, the former eight] together with the life faculty
and sex. But it is on account of respective prominence [of stiffenedness or
cohesion] that it comes to be styled "earth element" or "water element." This is
how they should be given attention to "by groups."
89. 3. By particles: in this body the earth element taken as reduced to fine dust
and powdered to the size of the smallest atom31 might amount to an average dona
measure full; and that is held together32 by the water element measuring half as
much. Being maintained33 by the fire element, and distended by the air element,
it does not get scattered or dissipated. Instead of getting scattered or dissipated,
it arrives at the alternative states of the female and male sex, etc., and manifests
smallness, bigness, length, shortness, toughness, rigidity and so on.

non-existent as to individual essence. On the contrary these do bear their own
characteristics, which is why they are elements" (Vism-mht 359). Capitals have been
used here and elsewhere though Indian alphabets do not justify it. Appayati—"to
satisfy" is not in PED; see Vibh-a 9.
30. "'From resolution of these eight': the eight dhammas beginning with colour when
resolved by means of understanding, are apprehendable (upalabbhauti) in the ultimate
sense through mutual negation (annam-anna-vyatirekena); but head hairs are not
apprehendable in the ultimate sense through negation of colour and so on.
Consequently, the term of common usage 'head hairs' is applied to these dhammas in
their co-arisen state; but if they are each taken separately, 'There is no common-usage
head hairs.' The meaning is that it is a mere conventional term. 'Only a mere group of eight
states' is said, taking the colour, etc., which are real (bhuta—lit. 'become'), as a unity by
means of the concept (pannatti) 'a head hair,' not only because they are merely the
eight states" (Vism-mht 360).
31.	Paramanu—"the smallest atom"; see Vibh-a 343. According to Viblva, the size of
a paramanu works out at 1/581,147,136th part of an angida (fingerbreadth or inch).
Vism-mht remarks (p. 361): "Therefore ... a paramanu as a particle of space is not the
province of the physical eye, it is the province of the divine eye."

90.	The liquid water element that is the mode of cohesion, being founded on
earth, maintained by fire, and distended by air, does not trickle or run away.34
Instead of trickling or running away it provides continued refreshments.35
91.	And here the fire element that cooks what is eaten, drunk, etc., and is the
mode of warming and has the characteristic of heat, being established on earth,
held together by water, and distended by air, maintains this body and ensures
its proper appearance. And this body, being maintained by it, shows no
putrefaction.
92.	The air element that courses through all the limbs and has the characteristic
of moving and distending, being founded upon earth, held together by water,
and maintained by fire, distends this body. And this body being distended by
the latter kind of air, does not collapse, but stands erect, and being propelled36 by
the other [motile] air, it shows intimation and it flexes and extends and it wriggles
the hands and feet, doing so in the postures comprising of walking, standing,
sitting and lying down. So this mechanism of elements carries on like a magic
trick, deceiving foolish people with the male and female sex and so on.
This is how they should be given attention bv particles.
93.	4. As to characteristic, etc.: he should advert to the four elements in this wav:
"The earth element—what are its characteristic, function, manifestation?"
[defining them in this way]: The earth element has the characteristic of hardness.
Its function is to act as a foundation. It is manifested as receiving. The water
element has the characteristic of trickling. Its function is to intensify. It is
manifested as holding together. The fire element has the characteristic of heat.
Its function is to mature (maintain). It is manifested as a continued supply of
softness. The air element has the characteristic of distending. Its function is to
cause motion. It is manifested as conveying.37 This is how they should be given
attention to by characteristic, and so on. [366]
94.	5. As to how originated: among the for tv-two components beginning with
head hairs shown in the detailed treatment of the earth element, etc., the four
consisting of gorge, dung, pus, and urine are temperature-originated only; the
four consisting of tears, sweat, spittle, and snot are temperature-originated and
consciousness-originated only. The fire that cooks what is eaten, etc., is kamma-
originated only; in-breath and out-breath are consciousness-originated only; all

(Vism-mht 361).
36.	Saniabbliahata—"propelled": see Ch. IV note 38.
37.	Abhimhara—"conveying": not in this sense in PED. "'Conveying' is acting as cause
for the successive arising at adjacent locations (desantaruppatti) of the conglomeration
of elements (bhiita-sangliata)" (Vism-mht 363). Elsewhere Vism-mht (p. 359) says of
the air element: "'It blows' (§87): it is stirred; the meaning is that the conglomeration of
elements is made to move (go) by its action as cause for successive arising at adjacent
locations (points)/' and "Propelling (saniabbhahana) is the act of causing the successive
arising at adjacent locations of material groups (rupa-kalapa)" (p. 362).
`361
Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
the rest are of fourfold origination. This is how they should be given attention as
to how originated.
95.	6. As to variety and unity: there is variety in the specific characteristics, etc.,
of all the elements; for the characteristic, function, and manifestation of the earth
element is one, and those of the water element, etc., are different. But there is
unity in them as materiality great primary element, state (dhamma), imperma-
nence, etc., notwithstanding the fact that they are various according to [specific]
characteristic, etc., and according to origination by kamma and so on.
96.	All these elements are "instances of materiality" (riipani) because they do
not exceed the characteristic of "being molested" (ruppana). They are "great
primaries" (malmbhuta) by reason of "great manifestation," and so on. "By reason
of 'great manifestation/ and so on" means that these elements are called "great
primaries" for the following reasons, namely: (a) manifestation of greatness; (b)
likeness to great creatures; (c) great maintenance; (d) great alteration; and (e)
because they are great and because they are entities.
97.	Herein, (a) manifestation of greatness: they are manifested as great both in a
continuity that is not clung to (acquired through kamma) and in a continuity
that is clung to. For their manifestation of greatness in a continuity that is not
clung to is given in the description of the recollection of the Buddha in the way
beginning:
Two times a hundred thousand [leagues]
And then four nahutas as well:
This earth, this "bearer of all wealth,"
Has that much thickness, as they tell (VII.41).
And they are manifested on a great scale also in a continuity that is clung to,
for instance, in the bodies of fishes, turtles, deities, Danava demons, and so on.
For this is said: "Bhikkhus, there are individual creatures of a hundred leagues
in the great ocean" (A IV 207), and so on.
98.	(b) Likeness to great creatures: just as a magician turns water that is not crystal
into crystal, and turns a clod that is not gold into gold, and shows them, and
being himself neither a spirit nor a bird, shows himself as a spirit or a bird, so
too, being themselves not blue-black, they turn themselves into blue-black derived
materiality being themselves not vellow ... not red ... not white, [367] they turn
themselves into white derived materiality and show that. In this way they are
"great primaries" (mahabhuta) in being like the great creatures (mahabhuta) of a
magician.38
--
38. "A great primary (mahabhuta) is a great wonder (mahanto abblmto) because it
shows various unreal things (abhuta), various wonders (abblmta), and various marvels
(acchariya). Or alternatively: there are great wonders (abblmta) here, thus there are
magicians. And spirits, etc., are huge (mahant) creatures (bhiita) owing to being born
from them, thus they are great primaries. Or alternatively: this term 'great primary'
can be regarded as a generic term for all of them. But earth, etc., are great primaries
because they deceive, and because, like the huge creatures, their standing place cannot
be pointed to. The deception lies in causing the apparent individual essences of
`362
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
99.	And just as, whomsoever the great creatures such as the spirits (yakkha)
grasp hold of (possess), thev have no standing place either inside him or outside
him and yet they have no standing independently of him, so too, these elements
are not found to stand either inside or outside each other yet they have no
standing independently of one another. Thus thev are also great primaries
(mahabhuta) in being equal to the great creatures (mahabhuta) such as the spirits
because they have no thinkable standing place [relative to each other].
100.	And just as the great creatures known as female spirits (yakkhinl) conceal
their own fearfulness with a pleasing colour, shape and gesture to deceive beings,
so too, these elements conceal each their own characteristic and function classed
as hardness, etc., by means of a pleasing skin colour of women's and men's
bodies, etc., and pleasing shapes of limbs and pleasing gestures of fingers, toes
and eyebrows, and they deceive simple people by concealing their own functions
and characteristics beginning with hardness and do not allow their individual
essences to be seen. Thus they are great primaries (mahabhuta) in being equal to
the great creatures (mahabhuta), the female spirits, since they are deceivers.
101.	(c) Great maintenance: this is because they have to be sustained by the great
requisites. For these elements are great primaries (mahabhuta) since they have
become (bhuta), have occurred, by means of the food, clothing, etc., which are
great (mahant) [in importance] because they have to be found every day Or
alternatively, they are great primaries (mahabhuta) since they are primaries whose
maintenance is great.
102.	(d) Great alteration: the unclung-to and the clung-to are the [basis of] great
alterations. Herein, the great alteration of the unclung-to evidences itself in the
emergence of an aeon (see XIII.34), and that of the clung-to in the disturbance of
the elements [in the body]. For accordingly:
The conflagration's flame bursts up
Out of the ground and races higher
And higher, right to the Brahma heaven,
When the world is burnt up by fire.
A whole world system measuring
One hundred thousand millions wide
Subsides, as with its furious waters
The flood dissolves the world beside.
--
blue-black, etc., and it lies in causing the appearance of what has the aspect of woman
and man, and so on. Likewise their undemonstrabilitv, since thev are not found inside
or outside each other though they rely upon each other for support. For if these
elements were found inside each other, they would not each perform their particular
functions, owing to mutual frustration. And if they were found outside each other,
they would be already resolved (separate), and that being so, any description of them
as unresolved (inseparable) would be meaningless. So although their standing place
is undemonstrable, still each one assists the other by its particular function—the
functions of establishing, etc., whereby each becomes a condition for the others as
conascence condition and so on" (Vism-mht 363).
`363
Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
One hundred thousand million leagues,
A whole world system's broad extent
Is rent and scattered, when the world
Succumbs to the air element.
The bite of wooden-mouths can make
The body stiff; to all intent,
When roused is its earth element,
It might be gripped by such a snake.
The bite of rotten-mouths can make
The body rot; to all intent,
When roused its water element,
It might be gripped by such a snake. [368]
The bite of fiery-mouths can make
The body burn; to all intent,
When roused is its fire element,
It might be gripped by such a snake.
The bite of dagger-mouths can make
The body burst; to all intent,
When roused is its air element,
It might be gripped by such a snake.
So thev are great primaries (mahabhuta) because they have become (bhuta) [the
basis of] great (mahant) alteration.
103.	(e) Because they are great and because they are entities: "great" (mahant) because
they need great effort to discern them, and "entities" (bhuta = become) because
they are existent; thus they are great primaries (mahabhuta) because they are
great (maha) and because they are entities (bhuta).
This is how all these elements are "great primaries" by reason of "great
manifestation," and so on.
104.	Again, they are elements (dhatu) because of bearing (dharana) their own
characteristics, because of grasping (adana) suffering, and because of sorting
out (adhana) suffering (see XV19), and because none of them are exempt from the
characteristic of being elements.
They are states (dhamma) owing to bearing (dharana) their own characteristics
and owing to their so bearing (dharana) for the length of the moment appropriate
to them.39 They are impermanent in the sense of [liability to] destruction; they
are painful in the sense of [causing] terror; they are not self in the sense of
having no core [of permanence, and so on]. Thus there is unity of all since all are
materiality great primaries, elements, states, impermanent, and so on.
This is how they should be given attention "as to variety and unity"
105. 7. As to resolution (separability) and non-resolution (inseparability): they are
positionally unresolvable (inseparable) since they always arise together in every
39. This alludes to the length of duration of a moment of matter's existence, which is
described as seventeen times as long as that of consciousness (see Vibh-a 25f.).
`364
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
single minimal material group consisting of the bare octad and the others; but they
are resolvable (separable) by characteristic. This is how they should be given attention
"as to resolution (separability) and non-resolution (inseparability)."
106.	8. As to the similar and dissimilar: and although they are unresolved
(inseparable) in this way yet the first two similar in heaviness, and so are the last
two in lightness; but [for this reason] the first two are dissimilar to the last two
and the last two to the first two. This is how they should be given attention "as to
the similar and dissimilar."
107.	9. As to distinction between internal and external: the internal elements are
the [material] support for the physical bases of consciousness, for the kinds of
intimation, and for the material faculties. They are associated with postures, and
they are of fourfold origination. The external elements are of the opposite kind.
This is how they should be given attention "as to distinction between internal
and external."
108.	10. As to inclusion: kamma-originated earth element is included together
with the other kamma-originated elements because there is no difference in
their origination. Likewise the consciousness-originated is included together
with other consciousness-originated elements. This is how they should be given
attention "as to inclusion."
109.	11. As to condition: the earth element, which is held together by water,
maintained by fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other three great
primaries by acting as their foundation. The water element, which is founded on
earth, maintained by fire and distended by air, is a condition for the other three
great primaries by acting as their cohesion. The fire element, which is founded
on earth, held together by water [369] and distended by air, is a condition for the
other three great primaries by acting as their maintaining. The air element,
which is founded on earth, held together by water, and maintained by fire, is a
condition for the other three great primaries by acting as their distension. This
is how they should be given attention "as to condition."
110.	22. As to lack of conscious reaction: here too the earth element does not know,
"I am the earth element" or "I am a condition by acting as a foundation for three
great primaries." And the other three do not know, "The earth element is a
condition for us by acting as a foundation for three great primaries." And the
other three do not know, "The earth element is a condition for us by acting as our
foundation." And similarly in each instance. This is how they should be given
attention "as to lack of conscious reaction."
111. 23. As to analysis of conditions: there are four conditions for the elements,
that is to say, kamma, consciousness, nutriment, and temperature.
Herein, kamma only is the condition for the kamma-originated [elements];
consciousness (citta), etc. [i.e. nutriment and temperature] are not. Consciousness,
etc., only are the conditions for the consciousness-originated [elements]; the
others are not. Kamma is the producing condition40 for the kamma-originated
--
40. "The term 'producing condition' refers to causing origination, though as a condition
it is actually kamma condition. For this is said: 'Profitable and unprofitable volition is

Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
elements; for the rest it is indirectly the decisive-supportive condition.41
Consciousness is the producing condition for the consciousness-originated
elements; for the rest it is the post-nascence condition, presence condition and
non-disappearance condition. Nutriment is the producing condition for the
nutriment-originated elements; for the rest it is the nutriment condition, presence
condition and non-disappearance condition. Temperature is the productive
condition for the temperature-originated elements; for the rest it is the presence
condition and non-disappearance condition.
Herein, the kamma-originated great primary is the condition for the kamma-
originated great primaries, and also for [the consciousness-originated [great
primaries]. Likewise are the consciousness-originated [great primary] and the
nutriment originated [great primary]. The temperature-originated great primary
is the condition for the temperature-originated great primaries, and also for the
kamma-originated [great primaries], and so on (cf. XX.27f.).
112. Herein, the kamma-originated earth element is a condition for the other
kamma-originated elements both as conascence, mutuality, support, presence,
and non-disappearance conditions and as foundation, but not as producing
condition. It is a condition for the other [three] great primaries in a triple
continuity (see XX.22) as support, presence and non-disappearance conditions,
but not as foundation or producing condition. And here the water element is a
condition for the remaining three elements both as conascence, etc., conditions
and as cohesion, but not as producing condition. And for the others in a triple
continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance
conditions too, but not as cohesion or producing condition. And the fire element
here is a condition for the other three elements both as conascence, etc., conditions
and as maintaining but not as producing condition. And for the others in a
triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-disappearance
conditions too, but not as maintaining or producing condition. And the air
element here is a condition for the other three elements [370] both as conascence,
etc., conditions and as distension, but not as producing condition. And for the
others in a triple continuity it is a condition as support, presence, and non-
disappearance conditions too, but not as distension or producing condition.
The same method applies in the case of the consciousness-originated, the
nutriment-originated, and the temperature-originated earth element, and the rest.
113. And when these elements have been made to occur through the influence
of the conascence, etc., conditions:
--
a condition, as kamma condition, for resultant aggregates and for materiality due to
kamma performed' (Patth I 5)" (Vism-mht 368).
41. "'For the rest': for consciousness-originated, and so on. It is the indirectly decisive-
support condition because in the Patthana the decisive-support condition has onlv
been given for immaterial dhammas, so there is, directly no decisive-support condition
[in kamma] for material dhammas. However, because of the words, 'With a person as
decisive support' (M I 107) and 'With a grove as decisive support' (M I 106) in the
Suttas, the decisive-support condition can be indirectly understood according to the
Suttas in the sense of 'absence without'" (Vism-mht 368).

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
With three in four ways to one due,
And likewise with one due to three;
With two in six ways due to two—
Thus their occurrence comes to be.
114. Taking each one, beginning with earth, there are three others whose
occurrence is due to that one, thus with three due to one their occurrence takes
place in four ways. Likewise each one, beginning with earth, occurs in
dependence on the other three, thus with one due to three their occurrence takes
place in four ways. But with the last two dependent on the first two, with the first
two dependent on the last two, with the second and fourth dependent on the
first and third, with the first and third dependent on the second and fourth,
with the second and third dependent on the first and fourth, and with the first
and fourth dependent on the second and third, they occur in six ways with two
elements due to two.
115.	At the time of moving forward and moving backward (M I 57), the earth
element among these is a condition for pressing. That, seconded by the water
element, is a condition for establishing on a foundation. But the water element
seconded bv the earth element is a condition for lowering down. The fire element
seconded by the air element is a condition for lifting up. The air element seconded
by the fire element is a condition for shifting forwards and shifting sideways
(see XX.62f. and M-a I 160).
This is how they should be given attention "as to analysis of conditions."
116.	As he gives his attention to them "as to word meaning," etc., in this wav,
the elements become evident to him under each heading. As he again and again
adverts and gives attention to them access concentration arises in the way already
described. And this concentration too is called "definition of the four elements"
because it arises in one who defines the four elements owing to the influence of
his knowledge.
117.	This bhikkhu who is devoted to the defining of the four elements immerses
himself in voidness and eliminates the perception of living beings. Since he
does not entertain false notions about wild beasts, spirits, ogres, etc., because he
has abolished the perception of living beings, he conquers fear and dread and
conquers delight and aversion (boredom); he is not exhilarated or depressed42
by agreeable and disagreeable things; and as one of great understanding, he
either ends in the deathless or he is bound for a happy destiny.
Defining the four elements
Is ever the wise man's resort;
The noble meditator lion43
Will make this mighty theme his sport.

Chapter XI
Concentration (conclusion): Nutriment and the Elements
[Development of Concentration—Conclusion]
118.	This completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the
clause, "How should it be developed?" in the set of questions beginning with
"What is concentration?" which was formulated in order to show the method of
development of concentration in detail (see III.l).
119.	This concentration as intended here is twofold, that is to say, access
concentration and absorption concentration. Herein, the unification [of mind]
in the case of ten meditation subjects and in the consciousness preceding
absorption [in the case of the remaining meditation subjects]44 is access
concentration. The unification of mind in the case of the remaining meditation
subjects is absorption concentration. And so it is developed in two forms with
the development of these meditation subjects. Hence it was said above: "This
completes in all its aspects the commentary on the meaning of the clause, 'How
should it be developed?'"
[The Benefits of Developing Concentration]
120.	The question, (viii) what are the benefits of the development of concentration?
was also asked, however (III.l). Herein, the benefits of the development of
concentration are fivefold, as a blissful abiding here and now, and so on. For the
development of absorption concentration provides the benefit of a blissful abiding
here and now for the Arahants with cankers destroyed who develop
concentration, thinking, "We shall attain and dwell with unified mind for a
whole day." Hence the Blessed One said: "But, Cunda, it is not these that are
called effacement in the Noble Ones' discipline; these are called blissful abidings
in the Noble Ones' discipline" (M I 40).
121.	When ordinary people and trainers develop it, thinking, "After emerging,
we shall exercise insight with concentrated consciousness," the development of
absorption concentration provides them with the benefit of insight by serving
as the proximate cause for insight, and so too does access concentration as a
method of arriving at wide open [conditions] in crowded [[circumstances].45
Hence the Blessed One said: "Bhikkhus, develop concentration; a bhikkhu who
is concentrated understands correctly" (S III 13).
122. But when they have already produced the eight attainments and then,
aspiring to the kinds of direct-knowledge described in the way beginning,
"Having been one, he becomes many" (XII.2), they produce them by entering
upon jhana as the basis for direct-knowledge and emerging from it, then the
development of absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of the
kinds of direct-knowledge, since it becomes the proximate cause for the kinds of
direct-knowledge whenever there is an occasion. Hence the Blessed One said:
--
44.	The sense demands reading with Vism-mht appanapiibba-blwgacittesii as a single
compound.
45.	This is an allusion to M I 179, etc. "The process of existence in the round of
rebirths, which is a very cramped place, is crowded by the defilements of craving and
so on" (Vism-mht 371).
`368
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
"He attains the ability to be a witness, through realization by direct-knowledge,
of any state realizable by direct-knowledge to which his mind inclines, whenever
there is an occasion" (M III 96; A I 254). [372]
123.	When ordinary people have not lost their jhana, and they aspire to rebirth
in the Brahma-world thus, "Let us be reborn in the Brahma-world," or even
though they do not make the actual aspiration, then the development of
absorption concentration provides them with the benefits of an improved form
of existence since it ensures that for them. Hence the Blessed One said: "Where
do they reappear after developing the first jhana limitedly? They reappear in the
company of the deities of Brahma's Retinue" (Vibh 424), and so on. And even
the development of access concentration ensures an improved form of existence
in the happy destinies of the sensual sphere.
124.	But when Noble Ones who have already produced the eight attainments
develop concentration, thinking, "We shall enter upon the attainment of cessation,
and bv being without consciousness for seven days we shall abide in bliss here
and now by reaching the cessation that is Nibbana," then the development of
absorption concentration provides for them the benefit of cessation. Hence it is
said: "Understanding as mastery owing to ... sixteen kinds of behaviour of
knowledge, and to nine kinds of behaviour of concentration, is knowledge of the
attainment of cessation" (Patis I 97; see Ch. XXIII, 18f.).
125.	That is how this benefit of the development of concentration is fivefold as
a blissful abiding here and now, and so on.
So wise men fail not in devotion
To the pursuit of concentration:
It cleans defiling stains' pollution,46
And brings rewards past calculation.
126.	And at this point in the Path of Purification, which is taught under the
headings of virtue, concentration and understanding in the stanza, "When a
wise man, established well in virtue ...," concentration has been fully explained.

Concentration" in the Path of Purification composed for

The Supernormal Powers
(Iddhividha-niddesa)
[The Benefits of Concentration (Continued)]
1. [373] It was said above with reference to the mundane kinds of direct-
knowledge that this development of concentration "provides ... the benefit of the
kinds of direct-knowledge" (XI.122). Now, in order to perfect those kinds of
direct-knowledge the task must be undertaken by a meditator who has reached
the fourth jhana in the earth kasina, and so on. And in doing this, not only will
this development of concentration have provided benefits in this way, it will also
have become more advanced; and when he thus possesses concentration so
developed as to have both provided benefits and become more advanced, he will
then more easily perfect the development of understanding. So meanwhile we
shall deal with the explanation of the kinds of direct-knowledge now
2. In order to show the benefits of developing concentration to clansmen whose
concentration has reached the fourth jhana, and in order to teach progressively
refined Dhamma, five kinds of mundane direct-knowledge have been described
by the Blessed One. They are: (1) the kinds of supernormal power, described in
the way beginning, "When his concentrated mind is thus purified, bright,
unblemished, rid of defilement, and has become malleable, wieldy steady, and
attained to imperturbability,1 he directs, he inclines, his mind to the kinds of
supernormal power. He wields the various kinds of supernormal power. Having
been one, he becomes many ..." (D I 77); (2) the knowledge of the divine ear
element; (3) the knowledge of penetration of minds; (4) the knowledge of
recollection of past lives; and (5) the knowledge of the passing away and
reappearance of beings.
[(1) The Kinds of Supernormal Power]
If a meditator wants to begin performing the transformation by supernormal
power described as, "Having been one, he becomes many" etc., he must achieve
the eight attainments in each of the eight kasinas ending with the white kasina.
He must also have complete control of his mind in the following fourteen ways:
[374] (i) in the order of the kasina, (ii) in the reverse order of the kasina, (iii) in the
1. Anenja—"imperturbability": a term normally used for the four immaterial states,
together with the fourth jhana. See also §16f., and MN 106.

order and reverse order of the kasina, (iv) in the order of the jhana, (v) in the
reverse order of the jhana (vi) in the order and reverse order of the jhana, (vii)
skipping jhana, (viii) skipping kasina, (ix) skipping jhana and kasina, (x)
transposition of factors, (xi) transposition of object, (xii) transposition of factors
and object, (xiii) definition of factors, and (xiv) definition of object.
3. But what is "in the order of the kasina" here? What is "definition of object"?
(i) Here a bhikkhu attains jhana in the earth kasina, after that in the water
kasina, and so progressing through the eight kasinas, doing so even a hundred
times, even a thousand times, in each one. This is called in the order of the kasinas.
(ii) Attaining them in like manner in reverse order, starting with the white kasina,
is called in the reverse order of the kasinas. (iii) Attaining them again and again in
forward and reverse order, from the earth kasina up to the white kasina and from
the white kasina back to the earth kasina, is called in the order and reverse order of
the kasinas.
4.	(iv) Attaining again and again from the first jhana up to the base consisting
of neither perception nor non-perception is called in the order of the jhanas. (v)
Attaining again and again from the base consisting of neither perception nor
non-perception back to the first jhana is called in the reverse order of the jhanas.
(vi) Attaining in forward and reverse order, from the first jhana up to the base
consisting of neither perception nor non-perception and from the base consisting
of neither perception nor non-perception back to the first jhana, is called in the
order and reverse order of the jhanas.
5.	(vii) He skips alternate jhanas without skipping the kasinas in the following
way: having first attained the first jhana in the earth kasina, he attains the third
jhana in that same kasina, and after that, having removed [the kasina (X.6), he
attains] the base consisting of boundless space, after that the base consisting of
nothingness. This is called skipping jhanas. And that based on the water kasina,
etc., should be construed similarly, (viii) When he skips alternate kasinas without
skipping jhanas in the following way: having attained the first jhana in the
earth kasina, he again attains that same jhana in the fire kasina and then in the
blue kasina and then in the red kasina, this is called skipping kasinas. (ix) When
he skips both jhanas and kasinas in the following way: having attained the first
jhana in the earth kasina, he next attains the third in the fire kasina, next the
base consisting of boundless space after removing the blue kasina, next the base
consisting of nothingness [arrived at] from the red kasina, this is called skipping
jhanas and kasinas.
6. (x) Attaining the first jhana in the earth kasina [375] and then attaining the
others in that same kasina is called transposition of factors, (xi) Attaining the first
jhana in the earth kasina and then that same jhana in the water kasina ... in the
white kasina is called transposition of object, (xii) Transposition of object and
factors together takes place in the following wav: he attains the first jhana in the
earth kasina, the second jhana in the water kasina, the third in the fire kasina,
the fourth in the air kasina, the base consisting of boundless space by removing
the blue kasina, the base consisting of boundless consciousness [arrived at]
from the yellow kasina, the base consisting of nothingness from the red kasina,
`371
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
and the base consisting of neither perception nor non-perception from the white
kasina. This is called transposition of factors and object.
7.	(xiii) The defining of only the jhana factors by defining the first jhana as five-
factored, the second as three-factored, the third as two-factored, and likewise
the fourth, the base consisting of boundless space, ... and the base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception, is called definition of factors, (xiv) Likewise,
the defining of only the object as "This is the earth kasina," "This is the water
kasina" ... "This is the white kasina," is called definition of object. Some would
also have "defining of factors and object"; but since that is not given in the
commentaries it is certainly not a heading in the development.
8.	It is not possible for a meditator to begin to accomplish transformation by
supernormal powers unless he has previously completed his development by
controlling his mind in these fourteen ways. Now, the kasina preliminary work
is difficult for a beginner and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The
—	" n —- —	-------------------------------------------
arousing of the sign is difficult for one who has done the preliminary work and
only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. To extend the sign when it has
arisen and to reach absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a
thousand can do it. To tame one's mind in the fourteen ways after reaching
absorption is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. The
transformation by supernormal power after training one's mind in the fourteen
ways is difficult and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. Rapid
response after attaining transformation is difficult and only one in a hundred or
a thousand can do it.
9. Like the Elder Rakkhita who, eight years after his full admission to the
Order, was in the midst of thirty thousand bhikkhus possessing supernormal
powers who had come to attend upon the sickness of the Elder Maha-Rohana-
Gutta at Therambatthala. [376] His feat is mentioned under the earth kasina
(IV135). Seeing his feat, an elder said, "Friends, if Rakkhita had not been there,
we should have been put to shame. [It could have been said], 'They were unable
to protect the royal naga/ So we ourselves ought to go about [with our abilities
perfected], just as it is proper (for soldiers) to go about with weapons cleaned of
stains." The thirty thousand bhikkhus heeded the elder's advice and achieved
rapid response.
10.	And helping another after acquiring rapidity in responding is difficult
and only one in a hundred or a thousand can do it. Like the elder who gave
protection against the rain of embers bv creating earth in the sky when the rain
of embers was produced by Mara at the Giribhandavahana offering. 2
11.	It is onlv in Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, chief disciples, etc., who have vast
previous endeavour behind them, that this transformation by supernormal power

Cetiyagirim adiin katva sakaladlpe samudde ca yava yojanci rnahati dlpapiija ('it is a name for
a great island-offering starting with the Cetivagiri (Mihintale) and extending over the
whole island and up to a league into the sea')." Mentioned in A-a to AN 1:1; M-a II398;
and Mahavamsa XXXIV81.
`372
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
and other such special qualities as the discriminations are brought to success
simply with the attainment of Arahantship and without the progressive course
of development of the kind just described.
12. So just as when a goldsmith wants to make some kind of ornament, he
does so only after making the gold malleable and wieldy by smelting it, etc., and
just as when a potter wants to make some kind of vessel, he does so only after
making the clay well kneaded and malleable, a beginner too must likewise
prepare for the kinds of supernormal powers by controlling his mind in these
fourteen ways; and he must do so also by making his mind malleable and wieldy
both by attaining under the headings of zeal, consciousness, energy and inquiry3
and by mastery in adverting, and so on. But one who already has the required
condition for it owing to practice in previous lives needs only prepare himself
by acquiring mastery in the fourth jhana in the kasinas.
13.	Now, the Blessed One showed how the preparation should be done in
saying, "When his concentrated mind," and so on. Here is the explanation,
which follows the text (see §2). Herein, he is a meditator who has attained the
fourth jhana. Thus signifies the order in which the fourth jhana comes; having
obtained the fourth jhana in this order beginning with attaining the first jhana,
is what is meant. Concentrated: concentrated by means of the fourth jhana. Mind:
fine-material-sphere consciousness.
14.	But as to the words "purified," etc., it is purified by means of the state of
mindfulness purified by equanimity. [377] It is bright precisely because it is
purified; it is limpid (see A I 10), is what is meant. It is unblemished since the
blemishes consisting of greed, etc., are eliminated by the removal of their
conditions consisting of bliss, and the rest. It is rid of defilement precisely because
it is unblemished; for it is by the blemish that the consciousness becomes defiled.
It has become malleable because it is well developed; it suffers mastery is what is
meant, for consciousness that suffers mastery is called "malleable." It is wieldy
(kammanlya) precisely because it is malleable; it suffers being worked
(kammakkhama), is fit to be worked (kammayogga), is what is meant.
15.	For a malleable consciousness is wieldy like well-smelted gold; and it is
both of these because it is well developed, according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, I do
not see anyone thing that, when developed and cultivated, becomes so malleable
and wieldy as does the mind" (A I 9).
16.	It is steady because it is steadied in this purifiedness, and the rest. It is
attained to imperturbability (anenjappatta) precisely because it is steady; it is
motionless, without perturbation (niritijana), is what is meant. Or alternatively it
is steady because steady in its own masterability through malleability and
wieldiness, and it is attained to imperturbability because it is reinforced by faith,
and so on.
17.	For consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by faithlessness;
when reinforced by energy it is not perturbed by idleness; when reinforced by
mindfulness, it is not perturbed by negligence; when reinforced by concentration,
--
3. These are the four headings of the roads to power (see §50).
`373
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
it is not perturbed by agitation; when reinforced by understanding, it is not
perturbed by ignorance; and when illuminated, it is not perturbed by the
darkness of defilement. So when it is reinforced by these six states, it is attained
to imperturbability.
18.	Consciousness possessing these eight factors in this way is susceptible
of being directed to the realization by direct-knowledge of states realizable by
direct-knowledge.
19.	Another method: It is concentrated by means of fourth-jhana concentration.
It is purified by separation from the hindrances. It is bright owing to the
surmounting of applied thought and the rest. It is unblemished owing to absence
of evil wishes based on the obtainment of jhana.4 It is rid of defilement owing to
the disappearance of the defilements of the mind consisting in covetousness,
etc.; and both of these should be understood according to the Anarigana Sutta
(MN 5) and the Vattha Sutta (MN 7). It is become malleable by masterability. It is
wieldy by reaching the state of a road to power (§50). It is steady and attained to
imperturbability by reaching the refinement of completed development; the
meaning is that according as it has attained imperturbability so it is steady.
And the consciousness possessing these eight factors in this way [378] is
susceptible of being directed to the realization by direct-knowledge of states
realizable bv direct-knowledge, since it is the basis, the proximate cause, for
them.
20.	He directs, he inclines, his mind to the kinds of supernormal powers (iddhi-
vidha—lit. "kinds of success"): here "success" (iddhi) is the success of
succeeding (ijjhana); in the sense of production, in the sense of obtainment, is
what is meant. For what is produced and obtained is called "successful,"
according as it is said, "When a mortal desires, if his desire is fulfilled"
(samijjhati) (Sn 766), and likewise: "Renunciation succeeds (ijjhati), thus it is a
success (iddhi) ... It metamorphoses (patiharati) [lust], thus it is a metamorphosis
(patihdriya)5 ... The Arahant path succeeds, thus it is a success ... It
metamorphoses [all defilements], thus it is a metamorphosis" (Patis II 229).
21.	Another method: success is in the sense of succeeding. That is a term for
the effectiveness of the means; for effectiveness of the means succeeds with the
production of the result intended, according as it is said: "This householder
Citta is virtuous and magnanimous. If he should aspire, 'Let me in the future
become a Wheel-turning Monarch,' being virtuous, he will succeed in his
aspiration, because it is purified" (S IV 303).
22. Another method: beings succeed by its means, thus it is success. They
succeed, thus they are successful; they are enriched, promoted, is what is meant.
--
4.	I.e. one wants it to be known that he can practice jhana.
5.	"It counter-strikes (patiharati), thus it is a counter-stroke (patiliariya—metamorphosis
= miracle). What strikes out (liarati), removes, what is counter to it (patipakklia) is
therefore called counter-striking (patiliariya), since what is counter-striking strikes
out anything counter (patipakklia) to itself. Patiliariya (counter-striking) is the same as
patiliariya (counter-stroke = metamorphosis = miracle)" (Vism-mlit 379).
`374
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
That [success (power)] is of ten kinds, according as it is said, "Kinds of success:
ten kinds of success," after which it is said further, "What ten kinds of success?
Success by resolve, success as transformation, success as the mind-made [body],
success by intervention of knowledge, success by intervention of concentration,
Noble Ones' success, success born of kamma result, success of the meritorious,
success through the sciences, success in the sense of succeeding due to right
exertion applied here or there" (Patis II 205).
23.	(i) Herein, the success shown in the exposition [of the above summary]
thus, "Normally one, he adverts to [himself as] many or a hundred or a thousand
or a hundred thousand; having adverted, he resolves with knowledge, "Let me
be many" (Patis II 207), is called success by resolve because it is produced by
resolving.
24.	(ii) That given as follows, "Having abandoned his normal form, he shows
[himself in] the form of a boy or the form of a serpent ... or he shows a manifold
military array" (Patis II 210), is called success as transformation because of the
abandoning and alteration of the normal form. [379]
25.	(iii) That given in this way "Here a bhikkhu creates out of this body another
body possessing visible form, mind-made" (Patis II 210), is called success as the
mind-made (body) because it occurs as the production of another, mind-made,
body inside the body.
26.	(iv) A distinction brought about by the influence of knowledge either
before the arising of the knowledge or after it or at that moment is called success
by intervention of knowledge; for this is said: "The meaning (purpose) as
abandoning perception of permanence succeeds through contemplation of
impermanence, thus it is success by intervention of knowledge ... The meaning
(purpose) as abandoning all defilements succeeds through the Arahant path,
thus it is success by intervention of knowledge. There was success by intervention
of knowledge in the venerable Bakkula. There was success by intervention of
knowledge in the venerable Sankicca. There was success by intervention of
knowledge in the venerable Bhutapala" (Patis II 211).
27.	Herein, when the venerable Bakkula as an infant was being bathed in the
river on an auspicious day, he fell into the stream through the negligence of his
nurse. A fish swallowed him and eventually came to the bathing place at Benares.
There it was caught by a fisherman and sold to a rich man's wife. The fish
interested her, and thinking to cook it herself, she slit it open. When she did so,
she saw the child like a golden image in the fish's stomach. She was overjoyed,
thinking, "At last I have got a son." So the venerable Bakkula's safe survival in a
fish's stomach in his last existence is called "success by intervention of
knowledge" because it was brought about by the influence of the Arahant-path
knowledge due to be obtained by [him in] that life. But the story should be told in
detail (see M-a IV 190).
28.	The Elder Sahkicca's mother died while he was still in her womb. At the
time of her cremation she was pierced by stakes and placed on a pyre. The infant
received a wound on the corner of his eve from the point of a stake and made a
sound. Then, thinking that the child must be alive, they took down the body and
`375
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
opened its belly. They gave the child to the grandmother. Under her care he grew
up, and eventually he went forth and reached Arahantship together with the
discriminations. So the venerable Sahkicca's safe survival on the pyre is called,
"success by intervention of knowledge" in the way just stated (see Dhp-a II 240).
29.	The boy Bhutapala's father was a poor man in Rajagaha. [380] He went
into the forest with a cart to get a load of wood. It was evening when he returned
to the city gate. Then his oxen slipped the yoke and escaped into the city. He
seated the child beside the cart and went into the city after the oxen. Before he
could come out again, the gate was closed. The child's safe survival through the
three watches of the night outside the city in a place infested by wild beasts and
spirits is called, "success by intervention of knowledge" in the wav just stated.
But the story should be told in detail.
30.	(v) A distinction brought about by the influence of serenity either before
the concentration or after it or at that moment is called success by intervention of
concentration for this is said: "The meaning (purpose) as abandoning the
hindrances succeeds by means of the first jhana, thus it is success by intervention
of concentration ... The meaning (purpose) as abandoning the base consisting
of nothingness succeeds by means of the attainment of the base consisting of
neither perception nor non-perception, thus it is success by intervention of
concentration. There was success by intervention of concentration in the venerable
Sariputta ... in the venerable Sanjlva ... in the venerable Khanu-Kondanna ... in
the laywoman devotee Uttara ... in the lay-woman devotee Samavatl" (Patis II
211-12).
31. Herein, while the venerable Sariputta was living with the Elder Maha
Moggallana at Kapotakandara he was sitting in the open on a moonlit night
with his hair newly cut. Then a wicked spirit, though warned by his companion,
gave him a blow on the head, the noise of which was like a thunder clap. At the
time the blow was given the elder was absorbed in an attainment; consequently
he suffered no harm from the blow. This was success by intervention of
concentration in that venerable one. The story is given in the Udana too (Ud 39).
32.	While the Elder Sarijiva was in the attainment of cessation, cowherds, etc.,
who noticed him thought he was dead. They brought grass and sticks and cow-
dung and set fire to them. Not even a corner of the elder's robe was burnt. This
was success by intervention of concentration in him because it was brought
about by the influence of the serenity occurring in his successive attainment [of
each of the eight jhanas preceding cessation]. But the storv is given in the Suttas
too (M I 333).
33.	The Elder Khanu Kondanna was naturally gifted in attainments. He was
sitting absorbed in attainment one night in a certain forest. [381] Five hundred
robbers came by with stolen booty Thinking that no one was following them
and needing rest, they put the booty down. Believing the elder was a tree stump
(jkhdnuka), they piled all the booty on him. The elder emerged at the predetermined
time just as they were about to depart after resting, at the very time in fact when
the one who had put his bootv down first was picking it up. When they saw the
elder move, they cried out in fear. The elder said, "Do not be afraid, lay followers;
`376
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
I am a bhikkhu." They came and paid homage. Such was their confidence in the
elder that they went forth into homelessness, and they eventually reached
Arahantship together with the discriminations. The absence here of harm to the
elder, covered as he was by five hundred bundles of goods, was success by
intervention of concentration (see Dhp-a II 254).
34.	The laywoman devotee Uttara was the daughter of a rich man called
Punnaka. A harlot called Sirima who was envious of her, poured a basin of hot
oil over her head. At that moment Uttara had attained [jhana in], loving-kindness.
The oil ran off her like water on a lotus leaf. This was success by intervention of
concentration in her. But the story should be given in detail (see Dhp-a III 310; A-
a I 451).
35.	King Udena's chief queen was called Samavatl. The brahman Magandiya,
who aspired to elevate his own daughter to the position of chief queen, put a
poisonous snake into Samavatl's lute. Then he told the king, "Samavatl wants to
kill you, sire. She is carrying a poisonous snake about in her lute." When the
king found it, he was furious. Intending to kill her, he took his bow and aimed a
poisoned arrow. Samavatl with her retinue pervaded the king with loving-
kindness. The king stood trembling, unable either to shoot the arrow or to put it
away Then the queen said to him, "What is it, sire, are you tired?"—"Yes, I am
tired."—"Then put down the bow." The arrow fell at the king's feet. Then the
queen advised him, "Sire, one should not hate one who has no hate." So the
king's not daring to release the arrow was success bv intervention of concentration
in the laywoman Samavatl (see Dhp-a I 216; A-a I 443).
36.	(vi) That which consists in dwelling perceiving the unrepulsive in the
repulsive, etc., is called Noble Ones' success, according as it is said: "What is
Noble Ones' success? Here, if a bhikkhu should wish, "May I dwell perceiving
the unrepulsive in the repulsive," he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive in that
... he dwells in equanimity towards that, mindful and fully aware" (Patis II 212).
[382] This is called "Noble Ones' success" because it is only produced in Noble
Ones who have reached mind mastery.
37.	For if a bhikkhu with cankers destroyed possesses this kind of success,
then when in the case of a disagreeable object he is practicing pervasion with
loving-kindness or giving attention to it as elements, he dwells perceiving the
unrepulsive; or when in the case of an agreeable object he is practicing pervasion
with foulness or giving attention to it as impermanent, he dwells perceiving the
repulsive. Likewise, when in the case of the repulsive and unrepulsive he is
practicing that same pervasion with loving-kindness or giving attention to it as
elements, he dwells perceiving the unrepulsive; and when in the case of the
unrepulsive and repulsive he is practicing that same pervasion with foulness or
giving attention to it as impermanent, he dwells perceiving the repulsive. But
when he is exercising the six-factored equanimity in the following way, "On
seeing a visible object with the eve, he is neither glad nor ..." (Patis II 213), etc.,
then rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive, he dwells in equanimity
mindful and fully aware.
`377
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
38.	For the meaning of this is expounded in the Patisambhida in the wav
beginning: "How does he dwell perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive? In
the case of a disagreeable object he pervades it with loving-kindness or he treats
it as elements" (Patis II 212). Thus it is called, "Noble Ones' success" because it
is only produced in Noble Ones who have reached mind mastery.
39.	(vii) That consisting in travelling through the air in the case of winged
birds, etc., is called success born of kamma result, according as it is said: "What is
success born of kamma result? That in all winged birds, in all deities, in some
human beings, in some inhabitants of states of loss, is success born of kamma
result" (Patis II 213). For here it is the capacity in all winged birds to travel
through the air without jhana or insight that is success born of kamma result;
and likewise that in all deities, and some human beings, at the beginning of the
aeon, and likewise that in some inhabitants of states of loss such as the female
spirit Piyankara's mother (see S-a II 509), Uttara's mother (Pv 140), Phussamitta,
Dhammagutta, and so on.
40.	(viii) That consisting in travelling through the air, etc., in the case of Wheel-
turning Monarchs, etc., is called success of the meritorious, according as it is said:
"What is success of the meritorious? The Wheel-turning Monarch travels
through the air with his fourfold army, even with his grooms and shepherds.
The householder Jotika had the success of the meritorious. The householder
Jatilaka had the success of the meritorious. [383] The householder Ghosita had
the success of the meritorious. The householder Mendaka had the success of the
meritorious. That of the five very meritorious is success of the meritorious" (Patis
II 213). In brief, however, it is the distinction that consists in succeeding when
the accumulated merit comes to ripen that is success of the meritorious.
41.	A crystal palace and sixty-four wishing trees cleft the earth and sprang
into existence for the householder Jotika. That was success of the meritorious in
his case (Dhp-a IV 207). A golden rock of eighty cubits [high] was made for
Jatilaka (Dhp-a IV 216). Ghosita's safe survival when attempts were made in
seven places to kill him was success of the meritorious (Dhp-a I 174). The
appearance to Mendaka (= Ram) of rams (mendaka) made of the seven gems in a
place the size of one sita 6 was success of the meritorious in Mendaka (Dhp-a III
364).
42. The "five very meritorious" are the rich man Mendaka, his wife
Candapadumasiri, his son the rich man Dhananjaya, his daughter-in-law
SumanadevI, and his slave Punna. When the rich man [Mendaka] washed his
head and looked up at the sky, twelve thousand five hundred measures were
filled for him with red rice from the sky. When his wife took a nali measure of
cooked rice, the food was not used up though she served the whole of Jambudlpa
with it. When his son took a purse containing a thousand [ducats (kahapana)],
the ducats were not exhausted even though he made gifts to all the inhabitants
--
6. Sita: not in this sense in PED Vism-mht (p. 383) says, "It is the path traversed by a
ploughshare in ploughing that is called a sltd." Another reading is karlsa (an area of
land).
`378
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
of Jambudlpa. When his daughter-in-law took a pint (tuniba) measure of paddy,
the grain was not used up even when she shared it out among all the inhabitants
of Jambudlpa. When the slave ploughed with a single ploughshare, there were
fourteen furrows, seven on each side (see Vin I 240; Dhp-a I 384). This was
success of the meritorious in them.
43.	(ix) That beginning with travelling through the air in the case of masters
of the sciences is success through the sciences, according as it is said: "What is
success through the sciences? Masters of the sciences, having pronounced their
scientific spells, travel through the air, and they show an elephant in space, in
the sky ... and they show a manifold military array" (Patis II 213).
44.	(x) But the succeeding of such and such work through such and such
right exertion is success in the sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or
there, according as it is said: "The meaning (purpose) of abandoning lust
succeeds through renunciation, thus it is success in the sense of succeeding due
----------------------O * ———— --------—	~	------------—----O-----
to right exertion applied here or there ... The meaning (purpose) of abandoning
all defilements succeeds through the Arahant path, thus it is success in the
sense of succeeding due to right exertion applied here or there" (Patis II 213).
[384] And the text here is similar to the previous text in the illustration of right
exertion, in other words, the way. But in the Commentary it is given as follows:
"Any work belonging to a trade such as making a cart assemblage, etc., any
medical work, the learning of the Three Vedas, the learning of the Three Pitakas,
even any work connected with ploughing, sowing, etc.—the distinction
produced by doing such work is success in the sense of succeeding due to right
exertion applied here or there."
45.	So, among these ten kinds of success, only (i) success by resolve is actually
mentioned in the clause "kinds of supernormal power (success)," but (ii) success
as transformation and (iii) success as the mind-made [body] are needed in this
sense as well.
46.	(i) To the kinds of supernormal power (see §20): to the components of
supernormal power, or to the departments of supernormal power. He directs, he
inclines, his mind: when that bhikkhu's consciousness has become the basis for
direct-knowledge in the way already described, he directs the preliminary-work
consciousness with the purpose of attaining the kinds of supernormal power,
he sends it in the direction of the kinds of supernormal power, leading it away
from the kasina as its object. Inclines: makes it tend and lean towards the
supernormal power to be attained.
47.	He: the bhikkhu who has done the directing of his mind in this way The
various: varied, of different sorts. Kinds of supernormal power: departments of
supernormal power. Wields: paccanubhoti = paccanu-bhavati (alternative form); the
meaning is that he makes contact with, realizes, reaches.
48.	Now, in order to show that variousness, it is said: "Having been one, [he becomes
many; having been many he becomes one. He appears and vanishes. He goes unhindered
through walls, through enclosures, through mountains, as though in open space. He
dives in and out of the earth as though in water. He goes on unbroken water as though on
earth. Seated cross-legged he travels in space like a winged bird. With his hand he
`379
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and powerful. He wields bodily
mastery even as tar as the Brahma-world]" (D I 77).
Herein, hairing been one: having been normally one before giving effect to the
supernormal power. He becomes many: wanting to walk with many or wanting to
do a recital or wanting to ask questions with many he becomes a hundred or a
thousand. But how does he do this? He accomplishes, (1) the four planes, (2) the
four bases (roads), (3) the eight steps, and (4) the sixteen roots of supernormal
power, and then he (5) resolves with knowledge.
49. 1. Herein, the four planes should be understood as the four jhanas; for this
has been said bv the General of the Dhamma [the Elder Sariputta]: "What are the
four planes of supernormal power? They are the first jhana as the plane born of
seclusion, the second jhana as the plane of happiness and bliss, the third jhana
as the plane of equanimity and bliss, the fourth jhana as the plane of neither
I	I	.	’	7	I
pain nor pleasure. These four planes of supernormal power lead to the attaining
of supernormal power, to the obtaining of supernormal power, to the
transformation due to supernormal power, to the majesty7 of supernormal power,
to the mastery of supernormal power, to fearlessness in supernormal power"
(Patis II 205). And he reaches supernormal power by becoming light, malleable
and wieldy in the body after steeping himself in blissful perception and light
perception due to the pervasion of happiness and pervasion of bliss, [385] which
is why the first three jhanas should be understood as the accessory plane since
they lead to the obtaining of supernormal power in this manner. But the fourth
is the natural plane for obtaining supernormal power.
50. 2. The four bases (roads) should be understood as the four bases of success
(iddhi-pada—roads to power); for this is said: "What are the four bases (pada—
roads) for success (iddhi—power)? Here a bhikkhu develops the basis for success
(road to power) that possesses both concentration due to zeal and the will to
strive (endeavour); he develops the basis for success (road to power) that possesses
both concentration due to energy and the will to strive; he develops the basis for
success (road to power) that possesses both concentration due to [natural purity
of] consciousness and the will to strive; he develops the basis for success (road
to power) that possesses both concentration due to inquiry and the will to strive.
These four bases (roads) for success (power) lead to the obtaining of supernormal
power (success) ... to the fearlessness due to supernormal power (success)"
(Patis II 205).
51. And here the concentration that has zeal as its cause, or has zeal outstanding,
is concentration due to zeal; this is a term for concentration obtained by giving
precedence to zeal consisting in the desire to act. Will (formation) as endeavour
is will to strive; this is a term for the energy of right endeavour accomplishing its
fourfold function (see §53). Possesses: is furnished with concentration due to zeal
and with the [four] instances of the will to strive.

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
52.	Road to power (basis for success): the meaning is, the total of consciousness
and its remaining concomitants [except the concentration and the will], which
are, in the sense of resolve, the road to (basis for) the concentration due to zeal
and will to strive associated with the direct-knowledge consciousness, which
latter are themselves termed "power (success)" either by treatment as
"production" (§20) or in the sense of "succeeding" (§21) or by treatment in this
way, "beings succeed by its means, thus they are successful; they are enriched,
promoted" (§22). For this is said: "Basis for success (road to power): it is the
feeling aggregate, [perception aggregate, formations aggregate, and]
consciousness aggregate, in one so become" (Vibh 217).
53.	Or alternatively: it is arrived at (pajjate) by means of that, thus that is a road
(pada—basis); it is reached, is the meaning. Iddhi-pada = iddhiya pada (resolution
of compound): this is a term for zeal, etc., according as it is said: "Bhikkhus, if a
bhikkhu obtains concentration, obtains unification of mind supported by zeal,
this is called concentration due to zeal. He [awakens zeal] for the non-arising of
unarisen evil, unprofitable states, [strives, puts forth energy, strains his mind
and] struggles. [He awakens zeal for the abandoning of arisen evil, unprofitable
states ... He awakens zeal for the arousing of unarisen profitable states ... He
awakens zeal for the maintenance, non-disappearance, increase, growth,
development and perfection of arisen profitable states, strives, puts forth energy
strains his mind and struggles]. These are called instances of the will to strive.
So this zeal and this concentration due to zeal and these [four] instances of will
to strive are called the road to power (basis for success) that possesses
concentration due to zeal and the will to strive" (S V 268). And the meaning
should be understood in this way in the case of the other roads to power (bases
for success).8
54. 3. The eight steps should be understood as the eight beginning with zeal;
for this is said: "What are the eight steps? If a bhikkhu obtains concentration,
obtains unification of mind supported by zeal, then the zeal is not the
concentration; the concentration is not the zeal. [386] The zeal is one, the
concentration is another. If a bhikkhu ... supported by energy ... supported by
[natural purity of] consciousness ... supported by inquiry ... then the inquiry is
not the concentration; the concentration is not the inquiry The inquiry is one, the
concentration is another. These eight steps to power lead to the obtaining of
supernormal power (success) ... to fearlessness due to supernormal power
(success)" (Patis II 205). For here it is the zeal consisting in the desire to arouse
supernormal power (success), which zeal is joined with concentration, that leads
to the obtaining of the supernormal power. Similarly in the case of energy and so
on. That should be understood as the reason why they are called the "eight
steps."
55. 4. The sixteen roots: the mind's unperturbedness9 should be understood in
sixteen modes, for this is said: "What are the sixteen roots of success (power)?

Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
Undejected consciousness is not perturbed by indolence, thus it is unperturbed.
Unelated consciousness is not perturbed by agitation, thus it is unperturbed.
Unattracted consciousness is not perturbed by greed, thus it is unperturbed.
Unrepelled consciousness is not perturbed by ill will, thus it is unperturbed.
Independent consciousness is not perturbed by [false] view, thus it is unperturbed.
Untrammelled consciousness is not perturbed by greed accompanied by zeal,
thus it is unperturbed. Liberated consciousness is not perturbed by greed for
sense desires, thus it is unperturbed. Unassociated consciousness is not
perturbed by defilement, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness rid of barriers is
not perturbed by the barrier of defilement, thus it is unperturbed. Unified
consciousness is not perturbed by the defilement of variety thus it is unperturbed.
Consciousness reinforced by faith is not perturbed by faithlessness, thus it is
unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by energy is not perturbed by indolence,
thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by mindfulness is not perturbed
by negligence, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by concentration is
not perturbed by agitation, thus it is unperturbed. Consciousness reinforced by
understanding is not perturbed by ignorance, thus it is unperturbed. Illuminated
consciousness is not perturbed by the darkness of ignorance, thus it is unperturbed.
These sixteen roots of success (power) lead to the obtaining of supernormal power
(success) ... to fearlessness due to supernormal power (success)" (Patis II 206).
56.	Of course, this meaning is already established by the words, "When his
concentrated mind," etc., too, but it is stated again for the purpose of showing
that the first jhana, etc., are the three planes, bases (roads), steps, and roots, of
success (to supernormal powers). And the first-mentioned method is the one
given in the Suttas, but this is how it is given in the Patisambhida. So it is stated
again for the purpose of avoiding confusion in each of the two instances.
57.	5. He resolves with knowledge (§48): when he has accomplished these things
consisting of the planes, bases (roads), steps, and roots, of success (to supernormal]
power), [387] then he attains jhana as the basis for direct-knowledge and emerges
from it. Then if he wants to become a hundred, he does the preliminary work
thus, "Let me become a hundred, let me become a hundred," after which he
again attains jhana as basis for direct-knowledge, emerges, and resolves. He
becomes a hundred simultaneously with the resolving consciousness. The same
method applies in the case of a thousand, and so on. If he does not succeed in
this way, he should do the preliminary work again, and attain, emerge, and
resolve a second time. For it is said in the Samyutta Commentary that it is
allowable to attain once, or twice.
58. Herein, the basic-jhana consciousness has the sign as its object; but the
preliminary-work consciousnesses have the hundred as their object or the
thousand as their object. And these latter are objects as appearances, not as
concepts. The resolving consciousness has likewise the hundred as its object or
the thousand as its object. That arises once only, next to change-of-lineage
[consciousness], as in the case of absorption consciousness already described
(IV78), and it is fine-material-sphere consciousness belonging to the fourth jhana.
`382

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
59.	Now, it is said in the Patisambhida: "Normally one, he adverts to [himself
as] many or a hundred or a thousand or a hundred thousand; having adverted,
he resolves with knowledge, 'Let me be many.' He becomes many, like the
venerable Cula-Panthaka" (Patis II 207). Here he adverts is said with respect only
to the preliminary work. Hairing adverted, he resolves with knowledge is said with
respect to the knowledge of the direct-knowledge. Consequently he adverts to
many. After that he attains with the last one of the preliminary-work
consciousnesses. After emerging from the attainment, he again adverts thus,
"Let me be many" after which he resolves bv means of the single [consciousness]
belonging to the knowledge of direct-knowledge, which has arisen next to the
three, or four, preparatory consciousnesses that have occurred, and which has
the name "resolve" owing to its making the decision. This is how the meaning
should be understood here.
60.	Like the venerable Cula-Panthaka is said in order to point to a bodily witness
of this multiple state; but that must be illustrated by the story There were two
brothers, it seems, who were called, "Panthaka (Roadling)" because they were
born on a road. The senior of the two was called Maha-Panthaka. He went forth
into homelessness and reached Arahantship together with the discriminations.
When he had become an Arahant, he made Cula-Panthaka go forth too, and he
set him this stanza: [388]
As a scented kokanada lotus
Opens in the morning with its perfume,
See the One with Radiant Limbs who glitters10
Like the sun's orb blazing in the heavens (A III 239; S I 81).
Four months went by, but he could not get it by heart. Then the elder said,
"You are useless in this dispensation," and he expelled him from the monastery.
61. At that time the elder had charge of the allocation of meal [invitations].
Jlvaka approached the elder, saying, "Take alms at our house, venerable sir,
together with the Blessed One and five hundred bhikkhus." The elder consented,
saying, "I accept for all but Cula-Panthaka." Cula-Panthaka stood weeping at
the gate. The Blessed One saw him with the divine eye, and he went to him.
"Why are you weeping?" he asked, and he was told what had happened.
62. The Blessed One said, "No one in my dispensation is called useless for
being unable to do a recitation. Do not grieve, bhikkhu." Taking him by the arm,
he led him into the monastery He created a piece of cloth by supernormal power
and gave it to him, saying, "Now, bhikkhu, keep rubbing this and recite over and
over again: 'Removal of dirt, removal of dirt.'" While doing as he had been told,
the cloth became black in colour. What he came to perceive was this: "The cloth
is clean; there is nothing wrong there. It is this selfhood that is wrong." He
brought his knowledge to bear on the five aggregates, and by increasing insight
he reached the neighbourhood of conformity [knowledge] and change-of-lineage
[knowledge].
10. Aiigirasa—"the One with Radiant Limbs": one of the epithets for the Buddha. Not
in PED; see A III 239.

Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
63. Then the Blessed One uttered these illuminative stanzas:
Now greed it is, not dust, that we call "dirt,"
And "dirt" is just a term in use for greed;
This greed the wise reject, and they abide
Keeping the Law of him that has no greed.
Now, hate it is, not dust, that we call "dirt,"
Delusion too, it is not dust, that we call "dirt,"
And "dirt" is just a term used for delusion;
Delusion the wise reject, and they abide
Keeping the Dhamma of him without delusion (Nidd I 505).
[389]
When the stanzas were finished, the venerable Cula-Panthaka had at his
command the nine supramundane states attended bv the four discriminations
and six kinds of direct-knowledge.
64.	On the following day the Master went to Jlvaka's house together with the
Community of Bhikkhus. Then when the gruel was being given out at the end of
the water-offering ceremony11 he covered his bowl. Jlvaka asked, "What is it,
venerable sir?"—"There is a bhikkhu at the monastery." He sent a man, telling
him, "Go, and return quickly with the lord."
65.	When the Blessed One had left the monastery:
Now, having multiplied himself
Up to a thousand, Panthaka
Sat in the pleasant mango wood
until the time should be announced (Th 563).
66.	When the man went and saw the monastery all glowing with yellow, he
returned and said, "Venerable sir, the monastery is crowded with bhikkhus. I do
not know which of them the lord is." Then the Blessed One said, "Go and catch
hold of the hem of the robe of the first one you see, tell him, The Master calls you'
and brine him here." He went and caught hold of the elder's robe. At once all the
creations vanished. The elder dismissed him, saving, "You may go," and when
he had finished attending to his bodily needs such as mouth washing, he arrived
first and sat down on the seat prepared.
It was with reference to this that it was said, "like the venerable Cula-Panthaka."
67. The many who were created there were just like the possessor of the
supernormal power because they were created without particular specification. Then
whatever the possessor of the supernormal powers does, whether he stands, sits, etc.,
or speaks, keeps silent, etc., they do the same. But if he wants to make them different
in appearance, some in the first phase of life, some in the middle phase, and some in
the last phase, and similarly some long-haired, some half-shaved, some shaved,
some grey-haired, some with lightly dyed robes, some with heavily dyed robes, or
expounding phrases, explaining Dhamma, intoning, asking questions, answering
--

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
questions, cooking dye, sewing and washing robes, etc., or if he wants to make still
others of different kinds, he should emerge from the basic jhana, do the preliminary
work in the way beginning 'Let there be so many bhikkhus in the first phase of life',
etc.; then he should once more attain and emerge, and then resolve. They become of
the kinds desired simultaneously with the resolving consciousness.12
68. The same method of explanation applies to the clause hairing been many\ he
becomes one: but there is this difference. After this bhikkhu thus created a manifold
state, then he again thinks, "As one only I will walk about, do a recital, [390] ask
a question," or out of fewness of wishes he thinks, "This is a monastery with few
bhikkhus. If someone comes, he will wonder, 'Where have all these bhikkhus
who are all alike come from? Surely it will be one of the elder's feats?' and so he
might get to know about me." Meanwhile, wishing, "Let me be one only" he
should attain the basic jhana and emerge. Then, after doing the preliminary
work thus, "Let me be one," he should again attain and emerge and then resolve
thus, 'Let me be one'. He becomes one simultaneously with the resolving
consciousness. But instead of doing this, he can automatically become one again
with the lapse of the predetermined time.
69.	He appears and vanishes: the meaning here is that he causes appearance,
causes vanishing. For it is said in the Patisambhida with reference to this: "'He
appears': he is not veiled by something, he is not hidden, he is revealed, he is
evident. 'Vanishes': he is veiled by something, he is hidden, he is shut away, he
is enclosed" (Patis II 207).13
Now, this possessor of supernormal power who wants to make an appearance,
makes darkness into light, or he makes revealed what is hidden, or he makes
what has not come into the visual field come into the visual field.
70.	How? If he wants to make himself or another visible even though hidden
or at a distance, he emerges from the basic jhana and adverts thus, "Let this that
is dark become light" or "Let this that is hidden be revealed" or "Let this that has
not come into the visual field come into the visual field." Then he does the
preliminary work and resolves in the way already described. It becomes as
resolved simultaneously with the resolve. Others then see even when at a distance;
and he himself sees too, if he wants to see.
12.	“'They become of the kinds desiredthey become whatever the kinds that were desired:
for they come to possess as many varieties in appearance, etc., as it was wished they
should have. But although they become manifold in this way by being made the object
in different modes of appearance, nevertheless it is only a single resolution
consciousness that occurs. This is its power. For it is like the single volition that
produces a personality possessed of many different facets (see Ch. XIV n. 14). And
there it is the aspiration to become that is a condition for the differentiation in the
kamma; and kamma-result is imponderable. And here too it is the preliminary-work
consciousness that should be taken as a condition for the difference. And the field of
supernormal power is imponderable too." (Vism-mht 390)
13.	Certain grammatical problems arise about the case of the words avibhavam, etc.,
both in the sutta passage and (more so) in the Patisambhida passage; thev are examined
by Vism-mht (p. 390) but are not renderable into English.
`385
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
71.	But by whom was this miracle formerly performed? By the Blessed One.
For when the Blessed One had been invited by Cula-Subhadda and was traversing
the seven-league journey between SavatthI and Saketa with five hundred
palanquins14 created by Vissakamma (see Dhp-a III 470), he resolved in suchwise
that citizens of Saketa saw the inhabitants of SavatthI and citizens of SavatthI
saw the inhabitants of Saketa. And when he had alighted in the centre of the city
he split the earth in two and showed Avici, and he parted the sky in two and
showed the Brahma-world.
72.	And this meaning should also be explained by means of the Descent of
the Gods (devorohana). When the Blessed One, it seems, had performed the Twin
Miracle15 and had liberated eighty-four thousand beings from bonds, he
wondered, "Where did the past Enlightened Ones go to when they had finished
the Twin Miracle?" He saw that they had gone to the heaven of the Thirty-three.
[391] Then he stood with one foot on the surface of the earth, and placed the
second on Mount Yugandhara. Then again he lifted his first foot and set it on
the summit of Mount Sineru. He took up the residence for the Rains there on the
Red Marble Terrace, and he began his exposition of the Abhidhamma, starting
from the beginning, to the deities of ten thousand world-spheres. At the time for
wandering for alms he created an artificial Buddha to teach the Dhamma.
73.	Meanwhile the Blessed One himself would chew a tooth-stick of nagalata
wood and wash his mouth in Lake Anotatta. Then, after collecting alms food
among the Uttarakurus, he would eat it on the shores of that lake. [Each day] the
Elder Sariputta went there and paid homage to the Blessed One, who told him,
"Today I taught this much Dhamma," and he gave him the method. In this way
he gave an uninterrupted exposition of the Abhidhamma for three months. Eighty
million deities penetrated the Dhamma on hearing it.
74.	At the time of the Twin Miracle an assembly gathered that was twelve
leagues across. Then, saying, "We will disperse when we have seen the Blessed
One," they made an encampment and waited there. Anathapindika the Lesser16
supplied all their needs. People asked the Elder Anuruddha to find out where
the Blessed One was. The elder extended light, and with the divine eye he saw
where the Blessed One had taken up residence for the Rains. As soon as he saw
this, he announced it.
75. They asked the venerable Maha Moggallana to pay homage to the Blessed
One. In the midst of the assembly the elder dived into the earth. Then cleaving

for the portable structure (catafalque) in which a bier is carried to the pyre. This, built
often in the form of a house, is still used now in Sri Lanka and called ransivi-ge. See A-a

Mount Sineru, he emerged at the Perfect One's feet, and he paid homage at the
Blessed One's feet. This is what he told the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, the
inhabitants of Jambudlpa pay homage at the Blessed One's feet, and they say,
'We will disperse when we have seen the Blessed One.'" The Blessed One said,
"But, Moggallana, where is your elder brother, the General of the Dhamma?"—
"At the city of Sankassa, venerable sir."—"Moggallana, those who wish to see
me should come tomorrow to the city of Sankassa. Tomorrow being the Uposatha
day of the full moon, I shall descend to the city of Sankassa for the Mahapavarana
ceremony"
76. Saying, "Good, venerable sir," the elder paid homage to Him of the Ten
Powers, and descending by the way he came, he reached the human
neighbourhood. And at the time of his going and coming he resolved that people
should see it. This, firstly, is the miracle of becoming apparent that the Elder
Maha Moggallana performed here. Having arrived thus, he related what had
happened, and he said, "Come forth after the morning meal and pay no heed to
distance" [thus promising that they would be able to see in spite of the distance].
77.	The Blessed One informed Sakka, Ruler of Gods, "Tomorrow, O King, I am
going to the human world." The Ruler of Gods [392] commanded Vissakamma,
"Good friend, the Blessed One wishes to go to the human world tomorrow. Build
three flights of stairs, one of gold, one of silver and one of crystal." He did so.
78.	On the following day the Blessed One stood on the summit of Sineru and
surveyed the eastward world element. Many thousands of world-spheres were
visible to him as clearly as a single plain. And as the eastward world element, so
too he saw the westward, the northward and the southward world elements all
clearlv visible. And he saw right down to Avici, and up to the Realm of the
Highest Gods. That day, it seems, was called the day of the Revelation of Worlds
(loka-vivarana). Human beings saw deities, and deities saw human beings. And
in doing so the human beings did not have to look up or the deities down. Thev
all saw each other face to face.
79.	The Blessed One descended by the middle flight of stairs made of crystal;
the deities of the six sense-sphere heavens by that on the left side made of gold;
and the deities of the Pure Abodes, and the Great Brahma, by that on the right
side made of silver. The Ruler of Gods held the bowl and robe. The Great Brahma
held a three-league-wide white parasol. Suyama held a yak-tail fan. Five-crest
(Pancasikha), the son of the gandhabba, descended doing honour to the Blessed
One with his bael-wood lute measuring three quarters of a league. On that day
there was no living being present who saw the Blessed One but yearned for
enlightenment. This is the miracle of becoming apparent that the Blessed One
performed here.
80. Furthermore, in Tambapanni Island (Sri Lanka), while the Elder
Dhammadinna, resident of Talarigara, was sitting on the shrine terrace in the
Great Monastery of Tissa (Tissamahavihara) expounding the Apannaka Sutta,
"Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu possesses three things he enters upon the
untarnished way" (A I 113), he turned his fan face downwards and an opening
right down to Avici appeared. Then he turned it face upwards and an opening
`387
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
right up to the Brahma-world appeared. Having thus aroused fear of hell and
longing for the bliss of heaven, the elder taught the Dhamma. Some became
stream-enterers, some once-returners, some non-returners, some Arahants.
81. But one who wants to cause a vanishing makes light into darkness, or he
hides what is unbidden, or he makes what has come into the visual field come
no more into the visual field. How? If he wants to make himself or another
invisible even though unconcealed or nearby, he emerges from the basic jhana
and adverts thus, "Let this light become darkness" or [393] "Let this that is
unhidden be hidden" or "Let this that has come into the visual field not come
into the visual field." Then he does the preliminary work and resolves in the
way already described. It becomes as he has resolved simultaneously with the
resolution. Others do not see even when they are nearby He too does not see, if
he does not want to see.
82.	But by whom was this miracle formerly performed? By the Blessed One.
For the Blessed One so acted that when the clansman Yasa was sitting beside
him, his father did not see him (Vin 116). Likewise, after travelling two thousand
leagues to meet [King] Maha Kappina and establishing him in the fruition of
non-return and his thousand ministers in the fruition of stream-entry he so
acted that Queen Anoja, who had followed the king with a thousand women
attendants and was sitting nearby, did not see the king and his retinue. And
when he was asked, "Have you seen the king, venerable sir?," he asked, But
which is better for you, to seek the king or to seek [your] self?" (cf. Vin I 23). She
replied, "[My] self, venerable sir." Then he likewise taught her the Dhamma as
she sat there, so that, together with the thousand women attendants, she became
established in the fruition of stream-entry while the ministers reached the fruition
of non-return, and the king that of Arahantsliip (see A-a I 322; Dhp-a II 124).
83.	Furthermore, this was performed by the Elder Mahinda, who so acted on
the day of his arrival in Tambapanni Island that the king did not see the others
who had come with him (see Mahavamsa I 103).
84.	Furthermore, all miracles of making evident are called an appearance,
and all miracles of making unevident are called a vanishing. Herein, in the
miracle of making evident, both the supernormal power and the possessor of the
supernormal power are displayed. That can be illustrated with the Twin Miracle;
for in that both are displayed thus: "Here the Perfect One performs the Twin
Miracle, which is not shared by disciples. He produces a mass of fire from the
upper part of his body and a shower of water from the lower part of his body ..."
(Patis 1125). In the case of the miracle of making unevident, onlv the supernormal
power is displayed, not the possessor of the supernormal power. That can be
illustrated by means of the Mahaka Sutta (S IV 200), and the Bralimanimantanika
Sutta (M I 330). For there it was only the supernormal power of the venerable
Mahaka and of the Blessed One respectively that was displayed, not the
possessors of the supernormal power, according as it is said:
85. "When he had sat down at one side, the householder Citta said to the
venerable Mahaka, 'Venerable sir, it would be good if the lord would show me a
miracle of supernormal power belonging to the higher than human state.'—
`388

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
'Then, householder, spread your upper robe out on the terrace [394] and scatter17
a bundle of hay on it.'—'Yes, venerable sir,' the householder replied to the
venerable Mahaka, and he spread out his upper robe on the terrace and scattered
a bundle of hav on it. Then the venerable Mahaka went into his dwelling and
fastened the latch, after which he performed a feat of supernormal power such
that flames came out from the keyhole and from the gaps in the fastenings and
burned the hay without burning the upper robe" (S IV 290).
86. Also according as it is said: "Then, bhikkhus, I performed a feat of
supernormal power such that Brahma and Brahma's retinue, and those attached
to Brahma's retinue might hear my voice and yet not see me, and having vanished
in this way, I spoke this stanza:
I saw the fear in [all kinds of] becoming,
Including becoming that seeks non-becoming;
And no becoming do I recommend;
I cling to no delight therein at all (M I 330).
87.	He goes unhindered through walls, through enclosures, through mountains, as
though in open space: here through walls is beyond walls; the yonder side of a wall,
is what is meant. So with the rest. And wall is a term for the wall of a house;
enclosure is a wall surrounding a house, monastery (park), village, etc.; mountain
is a mountain of soil or a mountain of stone. Unhindered: not sticking. As though
in open space: just as if he were in open space.
88.	One who wants to go in this way should attain the space-kasina [jhana]
and emerge, and then do the preliminary work bv adverting to the wall or the
enclosure or some such mountain as Sineru or the World-sphere Mountains,
and he should resolve, "Let there be space." It becomes space only; it becomes
hollow for him if he wants to go down or up; it becomes cleft for him if he wants
to penetrate it. He goes through it unhindered.
89.	But here the Elder Tipitaka Cula-Abhaya said: "Friends, what is the use of
attaining the space-kasina [jhana]? Does one who wants to create elephants,
horses, etc., attain an elephant-kasina jhana or horse-kasina jhana, and so on?
Surely the only standard is mastery in the eight attainments, and after the
preliminary work has been done on any kasina, it then becomes whatever he
wishes." The bhikkhus said, "Venerable sir, only the space kasina has been
given in the text, so it should certainly be mentioned."
90. Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the space-kasina attainment.
He adverts: "Through the wall, through the enclosure, through the mountain."
[395] Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: "Let there be space." There
is space. He goes unhindered through the wall, through the enclosure, through
the mountain. Just as men normally not possessed of supernormal power go
unhindered where there is no obstruction or enclosure, so too this possessor of
supernormal power, by his attaining mental mastery goes unhindered through

The Supernormal Powers
the wall, through the enclosure, through the mountain, as though in open space"
(Patis II 208).
91.	What if a mountain or a tree is raised in this bhikkhu's wav while he is
travelling along after resolving; should he attain and resolve again?—There is
no harm in that. For attaining and resolving again is like taking the dependence
(see Vin I 58; II 274) in the preceptor's presence. And because this bhjikkliu has
resolved, "Let there be space," there will be only space there, and because of the
power of his first resolve it is impossible that another mountain or tree can have
sprung up meanwhile made by temperature. However, if it has been created by
another possessor of supernormal power and created first, it prevails; the former
must go above or below it.
92.	He dives in and out of the ground (pathaviya pi ummujjanimmujjam): here it is
rising up that is called "diving out" (ummujja) and it is sinking down that is
called "diving in" (nimmujja). Ummujjanimmujjam = ummujjan ca nimmujjan ca
(resolution of compound).
One who wants to do this should attain the water-kasina [jhana] and emerge.
Then he should do the preliminary work, determining thus, "Let the earth in
such an area be water," and he should resolve in the way already described.
Simultaneously with the resolve, that much extent of earth according as
determined becomes water only It is there he does the diving in and out.
93.	Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the water-kasina attainment.
He adverts to earth. Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: "Let there be
water." There is water. He does the diving in and out of the earth. Just as men
normally not possessed of supernormal power do diving in and out of water, so
this possessor of supernormal power, by his attaining mental mastery does the
diving in and out of the earth as though in water" (Patis II 208).
94.	And he does not only dive in and out, but whatever else he wants, such as
bathing, drinking, mouth washing, washing of chattels, and so on. And not
only water, but there is whatever else (liquid that) he wants, such as ghee, oil,
honey molasses, and so on. When he does the preliminary work, after adverting
thus, "Let there be so much of this and this" and resolves, [396] it becomes as he
resolved. If he takes them and fills dishes with them, the ghee is onlv ghee, the
oil, etc., onlv oil, etc., the water only water. If he wants to be wetted by it, he is
wetted, if he does not want to be wetted by it, he is not wetted. And it is only for
him that that earth becomes water, not for anyone else. People go on it on foot and
in vehicles, etc., and they do their ploughing, etc., there. But if he wishes, "Let it
be water for them too," it becomes water for them too. When the time determined
has elapsed, all the extent determined, except for water originally present in
water pots, ponds, etc., becomes earth again.
95. On unbroken water: here water that one sinks into when trodden on is
called "broken," the opposite is called "unbroken." But one who wants to go in
this way should attain the earth-kasina [jhana] and emerge. Then he should do
the preliminary work, determining thus, "Let the water in such an area become
earth," and he should resolve in the way already described. Simultaneously
with the resolve, the water in that place becomes earth. He goes on that.
`390

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
96.	Here is the text: "He is normally an obtainer of the earth-kasina attainment.
He adverts to water. Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: 'Let there be
earth.' There is earth. He goes on unbroken water. Just as men normally not
possessed of supernormal power go on unbroken earth, so this possessor of
supernormal power, by his attaining of mental mastery goes on unbroken water
as if on earth" (Patis II 208).
97.	And he not onlv goes, but he adopts whatever posture he wishes. And not
onlv earth, but whatever else [solid that] he wants such as gems, gold, rocks,
trees, etc. he adverts to that and resolves, and it becomes as he resolves. And that
water becomes earth onlv for him; it is water for anyone else. And fishes and
turtles and water birds go about there as they like. But if he wishes to make it
earth for other people, he does so too. When the time determined has elapsed, it
becomes water again.
98.	Seated cross-legged he travels: he goes seated cross-legged. Like a winged
bird: like a bird furnished with wings. One who wants to do this should attain
the earth kasina and emerge. [397] Then if he wants to go cross-legged, he
should do the preliminary work and determine an area the size of a seat for
sitting cross-legged on, and he should resolve in the way already described. If
he wants to go lving down, he determines an area the size of a bed. If he wants
to go on foot, he determines a suitable area the size of a path, and he resolves in
the way already described: "Let it be earth." Simultaneously with the resolve it
becomes earth.
99.	Here is the text: "'Seated cross-legged he travels in space like a winged
bird': he is normally an obtainer of the earth-kasina attainment. He adverts to
space. Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: 'Let there be earth.' There
is earth. He travels (walks), stands, sits, and lies down in space, in the sky. Just as
men normally not possessed of supernormal power travel (walk), stand, sit, and
lie down on earth, so this possessor of supernormal power, by his attaining of
mental mastery travels (walks), stands, sits, and lies down in space, in the sky"
(Patis II 208).
100.	And a bhikkhu who wants to travel in space should be an obtainer of the
divine eye. Why? On the way there may be mountains, trees, etc., that are
temperature-originated, or jealous nagas, sup annas, etc., may create them. He
will need to be able to see these. But what should be done on seeing them? He
should attain the basic jhana and emerge, and then he should do the preliminary
work thus, "Let there be space," and resolve.
101.	But the Elder [Tipitaka Cula-Abliaya] said: "Friends, what is the use of
attaining the attainment? Is not his mind concentrated? Hence anv area that he
has resolved thus, 'Let it be space' is space." Though he spoke thus, nevertheless
the matter should be treated as described under the miracle of going unhindered
through walls. Moreover, he should be an obtainer of the divine eve for the
purpose of descending in a secluded place, for if he descends in a public place,
in a bathing place, or at a village gate, he is exposed to the multitude. So, seeing
with the divine eve, he should avoid a place where there is no open space and
descend in an open space.
`391
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
102.	With his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so mighty and power fid:
here the "might" of the moon and sun should be understood to consist in the
fact that they travel at an altitude of forty-two thousand leagues, and their "power"
to consist in their simultaneous illuminating of three [of the four] continents.
[398] Or thev are "mighty" because thev travel overhead and give light as they
do, and they are "powerful" because of that same might. He touches: he seizes, or
he touches in one place. Strokes: he strokes all over, as if it were the surface of a
looking-glass.
103.	This supernormal power is successful simply through the jhana that is
made the basis for direct-knowledge; there is no special kasina attainment here.
For this is said in the Patisambhida: "'With his hand ... so mighty and powerful':
here this possessor of supernormal power who has attained mind mastery ...
adverts to the moon and sun. Having adverted, he resolves with knowledge: 'Let
it be within hand's reach.' It is within hand's reach. Sitting or lying down, with
his hand he touches, makes contact with, strokes the moon and sun. Just as men
normally not possessed of supernormal power touch, make contact with, stroke,
some material object within hand's reach, so this possessor of supernormal
power, by his attaining of mental mastery sitting or lying down, with his hands
touches, makes contact with, strokes the moon and sun" (Patis II 298).
104.	If he wants to go and touch them, he goes and touches them. But if he
wants to touch them here sitting or lying down, he resolves: "Let them be within
hand's reach. Then he either touches them as they stand within hand's reach
when they have come by the power of the resolve like palmyra fruits loosened
from their stalk, or he does so by enlarging his hand. But when he enlarges his
hand, does he enlarge what is clung to or what is not clung to? He enlarges
what is not clung to supported by what is clung to.
105.	Here the Elder Tipitaka Cula-Naga said: "But, friends, why does what is
clung to not become small and big too? When a bhikkhu comes out through a
keyhole, does not what is clung to become small? And when he makes his body
big, does it not then become big, as in the case of the Elder Maha Moggallana?"
106.	At one time, it seems, when the householder Anathapindika had heard
the Blessed One preaching the Dhamma, he invited him thus, Venerable sir, take
alms at our house together with five hundred bhikkhus/' and then he departed.
The Blessed One consented. When the rest of that day and part of the night had
passed, he surveyed the ten-thousandfold world element in the early morning.
Then the royal naga (serpent) called Nandopananda came within the range of
his knowledge.
107. The Blessed One considered him thus: "This royal naga has come into
the range of my knowledge. Has he the potentiality for development?" Then he
saw that he had wrong view and no confidence in the Three Jewels. [399] He
considered thus, "Who is there that can cure him of his wrong view?" He saw
that the Elder Maha Moggallana could. Then when the night had turned to
dawn, after he had seen to the needs of the body he addressed the venerable
Ananda: "Ananda, tell five hundred bhikkhus that the Perfect One is going on
a visit to the gods."
`392
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
108.	It was on that day that they had got a banqueting place ready for
Nandopananda. He was sitting on a divine couch with a divine white parasol
held aloft, surrounded by the three kinds of dancers18 and a retinue of nagas,
and surveying the various kinds of food and drink served up in divine vessels.
Then the Blessed One so acted that the roval naga saw him as he proceeded
directly above his canopy in the direction of the divine world of the Thirty-three,
accompanied by the five hundred bhikkhus.
109.	Then this evil view arose in Nandopananda the royal naga: "There go
these bald-headed monks in and out of the realm of the Thirty-three directly over
my realm. I will not have them scattering the dirt off their feet on our heads." He
got up, and he went to the foot of Sineru. Changing his form, he surrounded it
seven times with his coils. Then he spread his hood over the realm of the Thirty-
three and made everything there invisible.
110.	The venerable Ratthapala said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, standing
in this place formerly I used to see Sineru and the ramparts of Sineru,19 and the
Thirty-three, and the Vejayanta Palace, and the flag over the Vejayanta Palace.
Venerable sir, what is the cause, what is the reason, why I now see neither Sineru
nor ... the flag over the Vejayanta Palace?"—"This royal naga called
Nandopananda is angrv with us, Ratthapala. He has surrounded Sineru seven
times with his coils, and he stands there covering us with his raised hood,
making it dark."—"I will tame him, venerable sir." But the Blessed One would
not allow it. Then the venerable Bhaddiya and the venerable Rahula and all the
bhikkhus in turn offered to do so, but the Blessed One would not allow it.
111.	Last of all the venerable Maha Moggallana said, "I will tame him, venerable
sir." The Blessed One allowed it, saying, "Tame him, Moggallana." The elder
abandoned that form and assumed the form of a huge royal naga, and he
surrounded Nandopananda fourteen times with his coils and raised his hood
above the other's hood, and he squeezed him against Sineru. The roval naga
produced smoke. [400] The elder said, "There is smoke not only in your body but
also in mine," and he produced smoke. The royal naga's smoke did not distress
the elder, but the elder's smoke distressed the royal naga. Then the royal naga
produced flames. The elder said, "There is fire not only in your body but also in
mine," and he produced flames. The royal naga's fire did not distress the elder,
but the elder's fire distressed the royal naga.
112. The royal naga thought, "He has squeezed me against Sineru, and he has
produced both smoke and flames." Then he asked, "Sir, who are you?"—"I am
Moggallana, Nanda."—"Venerable sir, resume your proper bhikkhu's state." The
elder abandoned that form, and he went into his right ear and came out from his left
ear; then he went into his left ear and came out from his right ear. Likewise he went

19.	'"The ramparts of Sineru': the girdle of Sineru. There are, it seems, four ramparts
that encircle Sineru, measuring 5,000 leagues in breadth and width. They were built to
protect the realm of the Thirty-three against nagas, garudas, kumbhandas and vakkhas.
They enclose half of Sineru, it seems" (Vism-mht 394).

into his right nostril and came out from his left nostril; then he went into his left
nostril and came out from his right nostril. Then the royal naga opened his mouth.
The elder went inside it, and he walked up and down, east and west, inside his belly
113.	The Blessed One said, "Moggallana, Moggallana, beware; this is a
mighty naga." The elder said, "Venerable sir, the four roads to power have been
developed by me, repeatedly practiced, made the vehicle, made the basis,
established, consolidated, and properly undertaken. I can tame not only
Nandopananda, venerable sir, but a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand
royal nagas like Nandopananda."
114.	The royal naga thought, "When he [went in the first place I did not see
him. But now when he comes out I shall catch him between my fangs and chew
him up." Then he said, "Venerable sir, come out. Do not keep troubling me by
walking up and down inside my bellv." The elder came out and stood outside.
The royal naga recognized him, and blew a blast from his nose. The elder attained
——* -----^ -----“--------------------------------------——
the fourth jhana, and the blast failed to move even a single hair on his body. The
other bhikkhus would, it seems, have been able to perform all the miracles up to
now, but at this point they could not have attained with so rapid a response,
which is why the Blessed One would not allow them to tame the royal naga.
115.	The royal naga thought, "I have been unable to move even a single hair on
this monk's body with the blast from my nose. He is a mighty monk." The elder
abandoned that form, and having assumed the form of a supanna, he pursued the
royal naga demonstrating the supanna's blast. [401] The royal naga abandoned
that form, and having assumed the form of a young brahman, he said, "Venerable
sir, I go for refuge to vou," and he paid homage at the elder's feet. The elder said,
"The Master has come, Nanda; come, let us go to him." So having tamed the royal
naga and deprived him of his poison, he went with him to the Blessed One's presence.
116.	The royal naga paid homage to the Blessed One and said, "Venerable sir,
I go for refuge to you." The Blessed One said, "May you be happy royal naga."
Then he went, followed by the Community of Bhikkhus, to Anathapindika's
house. Anathapindika said, "Venerable sir, why have you come so late?"—"There
was a battle between Moggallana and Nandopananda."—"Who won, venerable
sir? Who was defeated?"—"Moggallana won; Nanda was defeated."
Anathapindika said, "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One consent to my providing
meals for seven days in a single series, and to my honouring the elder for seven
days." Then for seven days he accorded great honour to the five hundred
bhikkhus with the Enlightened One at their head.
117. So it was with reference to this enlarged form created during this taming
of Nandopananda that it was said: "When he makes his body big, does it not
then become big, as in the case of the Elder Maha Moggallana?" (§105). Although
this was said, the bhikkhus observed, "He enlarges only what is not clung to
supported by what is clung to." And only this is correct here.20
20. "Only this is correct because instances of clung-to (kammically acquired) materiality
do not arise owing to consciousness or to temperature. Or alternatively 'clung-to' is
intended as all matter that is bound up with faculties (i.e. 'sentient'), too. And so to

118.	And when he has done this, he not only touches the moon and sun, but if
he wishes, he makes a footstool [of them] and puts his feet on it, he makes a chair
[of them] and sits on it, he makes a bed [of them] and lies on it, he makes a
leaning-plank [of them] and leans on it. And as one does, so do others. For even
when several hundred thousand bhikkhus do this and each one succeeds, still
the motions of the moon and sun and their radiance remain the same. For just as
when a thousand saucers are full of water and moon disks are seen in all the
saucers, still the moon's motion is normal and so is its radiance. And this miracle
resembles that.
119.	Even as far as the Brahma-world: having made even the Brahma-world the
limit. He wields bodily mastery: herein, he wields self-mastery in the Brahma-
world by means of the body The meaning of this should be understood according
to the text.
Here is the text: "'He wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-
world': if this possessor of supernormal power, having reached mental mastery
wants to go to the Brahma-world, though far, he resolves upon nearness, 'Let it
be near/ [402] It is near. Though near, he resolves upon farness, 'Let it be far.' It
is far. Though many, he resolves upon few, 'Let there be few.' There are few.
Though few, he resolves upon many 'Let there be many.' There are many With
the divine eye he sees the [fine-material] visible form of that Brahma. With the
divine ear element he hears the voice of that Brahma. With the knowledge of
penetration of minds he understands that Brahma's mind. If this possessor of
supernormal power, having reached mental mastery wants to go to the Brahma-
world with a visible body he converts his mind to accord with his body he
resolves his mind to accord with his body Having converted his mind to accord
with his bodv, resolved his mind to accord with his body he arrives at blissful
(easy) perception and light (quick) perception, and he goes to the Brahma-
world with a visible body. If this possessor of supernormal power, having reached
mental mastery wants to go to the Brahma-world with an invisible bodv, he
converts his body to accord with his mind, he resolves his body to accord with
his mind. Having converted his body to accord with his mind, resolved his body
to accord with his mind, he arrives at blissful (easy) perception and light (quick)
perception, and he goes to the Brahma-world with an invisible body He creates
a [fine-material] visible form before that Brahma, mind-made with all its limbs,
lacking no faculty If that possessor of supernormal power walks up and down,
--
take it as enlargement of that is likewise not correct. Consequently enlargement
should be understood only in the way stated. Though the clung-to and the unclung-to
occur, as it were, mixed up in a single continuity they are nevertheless not mixed up in
meaning. Herein, just as when a pint measure (alhaka) of milk is poured into a number
of pints of water, though the milk becomes completely mixed up with the water, and is
present appreciably in all, it is nevertheless not the milk that has increased there, but
only the water. And so too, although the clung-to and unclung-to occur mixed up
together, it is nevertheless not the clung-to that is enlarged. It should be taken that it
is the consciousness-born matter that is enlarged by the influence of the supernormal
power, and the temperature-born is enlarged pari passu" (Vism-mht 395).
`395
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
the creation walks up and down there too. If that possessor of supernormal
power stands ... sits ... lies down, the creation lies down there too. If that possessor
of supernormal power produces smoke ... produces flames ... preaches Dhamma
... asks a question ... being asked a question, answers, the creation, being asked
a question, answers there too. If that possessor of supernormal power stands
with that Brahma, converses, enters into communication with that Brahma, the
creation stands with that Brahma there too, converses, enters into communication
with that Brahma there too. Whatever that possessor of supernormal power does,
the creation does the same thing'" (Patis II 209).
120. Herein, though far, he resolves upon nearness: having emerged from the basic
jhana, he adverts to a far-off world of the gods or to the Brahma-world thus, "Let
it be near." Having adverted and done the preliminary work, he attains again,
and then resolves with knowledge: "Let it be near." It becomes near. The same
method of explanation applies to the other clauses too.
121.	Herein, who has taken what was far and made it near? The Blessed One.
For when the Blessed One was going to the divine world after the Twin Miracle,
he made Yugandhara and Sineru near, and from the earth's surface he set one
foot [403] on Yugandhara, and then he set the other on the summit of Sineru.
122.	Who else has done it? The Elder Maha Moggallana. For when the elder
was leaving SavatthI after completing his meal, he abridged the twelve-league
crowd and the thirty-league road to the city of Sankassa, and he arrived at the
same moment.
123.	Furthermore, the Elder Cilia Samudda did it as well in Tambapanni Island.
During a time of scarcity, it seems, seven hundred bhikkhus came to the elder
one morning. The elder thought, "Where can a large community of bhikkhus
wander for alms?" He saw nowhere at all in Tambapanni Island, but he saw that
it would be possible on the other shore at Pataliputta (Patna). He got the bhikkhus
to take their bowls and [outer] robes, and he said, "Come friends, let us go
wandering for alms." Then he abridged the earth and went to Pataliputta. The
bhikkhus asked, "What is the city, venerable sir?"—"It is Pataliputta, friends."—
"Pataliputta is far away, venerable sir."—"Friends, experienced elders make what
is far near."—"Where is the ocean (maha-samudda), venerable sir?"—"Friends,
did you not cross a blue stream on the way as you came?"—"Yes, venerable sir,
but the ocean is vast."—"Friends, experienced elders also make what is vast
small."
124.	And the Elder Tissadatta did likewise, when he had put on his upper
robes after bathing in the evening, and the thought of paying homage at the
Great Enlightenment Tree arose in him.
125.	Who has taken what was near and made it far? The Blessed One. For
although Arigulimala was near to the Blessed One, yet he made him far (see M II
99).
126.	Who has made much little? The Elder Maha Kassapa. One feast day at
Rajagaha, it seems, there were five hundred girls on their way to enjoy the festival,
and they had taken moon cakes with them. They saw the Blessed One but gave
`396
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
him nothing. On their way back, however, thev saw the elder. Thinking, "He is
our elder," they each took a cake and approached the elder. The elder took out
his bowl and made a single bowlful of them all. The Blessed One had sat down
first to await the elder. The elder brought them and gave them to the Blessed One.
127. In the story of the rich man Illlsa, however, (J-a I 348; Dhp-a I 372) the Elder
Maha Moggallana made little much. And in the story of Kakavaliya the Blessed
One did so. The Elder Maha Kassapa, it seems, after spending seven days in
attainment, stood at the house door of a man in poor circumstances called
Kakavaliya in order to show favour to the poor. [404] His wife saw the elder, and
she poured into his bowl the unsalted sour gruel that she had cooked for her
husband. The elder took it and placed it in the Blessed One's hand. The Blessed
One resolved to make it enough for the Greater Community of Bhikkhus. What
was brought in a single bowl became enough for all. And on the seventh day
Kakavaliya became a rich man.
128.	And not only in the case of making little much, but whatever the possessor
of supernormal power wishes, whether to make the sweet unsweet, etc., it is
successful for him. For so it was that when the Elder Maha Anula saw many
bhikkhus sitting on the banks of the Gahga River [in Sri Lanka] eating plain rice,
which was all that thev had got after doing their alms round, he resolved, "Let
the Gahga River water be cream of ghee," and he gave a sign to the novices. They
fetched it in their vessels and gave it to the Community of Bhikkhus. All of them
ate their meal with sweet cream of ghee.
129.	With the divine eye: remaining here and extending light, he sees the visible
form of that Brahma. And remaining here he also hears the sound of his speech
and he understands his mind.
130.	He converts his mind according to Ins body: he converts the mind to accord
with the material body; taking the consciousness of the basic jhana, he mounts
it upon the body he makes its going slow to coincide with that of the body; for
the body's mode of going is slow.
131.	He arrives at blissful perception and light perception: he arrives at, enters,
7	I	J	O	I	J	'	r
makes contact with, reaches, the perception of bliss and perception of lightness
that are conascent with the consciousness whose object is the basic jhana. And
it is perception associated with equanimity that is called "perception of bliss";
for equanimity is called "bliss" since it is peaceful. And that same perception
should be understood to be called "perception of lightness" too because it is
liberated from hindrances and from the things that oppose it beginning with
applied thought. But when he arrives at that state, his physical bodv too becomes
as light as a tuft of cotton. He goes to the Brahma-world thus with a visible bodv
as light as a tuft of cotton wafted by the wind.
132. As he goes thus, if he wishes, he creates a path in space by means of the
earth kasina and goes on foot. If he wishes, he resolves by means of the air kasina
that there shall be air, and he goes by air like a tuft of cotton. Moreover, the desire
to go is the measure here. When there is the desire to go, one who has made his
mental resolve in this wav goes visibly carried by the force of the resolution like
an arrow shot by an archer. [405]
`397
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
133.	He converts his body to accord with his mind: he takes the bodv and mounts
it on the mind. He makes its going swift to coincide with that of the mind; for the
mind's mode of going is swift.
He arrives at blissful perception and light perception: he arrives at perception
of bliss and perception of lightness that are conascent with the supernormal-
power consciousness whose object is the material body. The rest should be
understood in the way already described. But here there is only the going of
consciousness.21
134.	When it was asked, "As he goes with an invisible body thus, does he
go at the moment of the resolution-consciousness's arising or at the moment
of its presence or at the moment of its dissolution?", an elder replied, "He
goes in all three moments."—"But does he go himself, or does he send a
creation?"—"He does as he pleases. But here it is only the going himself that
has been given [in the text]."
135. Mind-made: mind-made because created by the mind in resolution. Lacking
no faculty: this refers to the shape of the eye, ear, etc.; but there is no sensitivity in
--
21. "'There is only the going of consciousness': there is only a going that is the same as
that of the mind. But how does the body whose going [being that of matter] is slow,
come to have the same going as the mind, which quickly passes? Its going is not the
same in all respects; for in the case of converting the mind to conform with the body
the mind does not come to have the same going as the body in all respects. For it is not
that the mind then occurs with the moment of a material state, which passes slowly
instead of passing with its own kind of moment, which is what establishes its individual
essence. But rather the mind is called 'converted to accord with the going of the body'
as long as it goes on occurring in a continuity that conforms with the body until the
desired place is arrived at. This is because its passing occurs parallel with that of the
body, whose going is slow, owing to the resolution, 'Let the mind be like this body.'
And likewise, it is while the body keeps occurring in suchwise that its arrival at the
desired place comes about in only a few quick passes of the mind instead of passing
slowly as in those who have not developed the roads to power—and this mode of
occurrence is due to the possession of the perception of lightness, to say nothing of
the resolve, 'Let this body be like this mind'—that the body is called 'converted to
accord with the going of the mind,' not because it arrives at the desired place in a
single consciousness moment. And when taken thus the simile, 'Just as a strong man
might stretch out his bent arm, or bend his outstretched arm' (Vin I 5) can be taken
literally And this must be accepted in this way without reserve, otherwise there is
conflict with the Suttas, the Abhidhamma and the Commentary as well as contradiction
of natural law (dhammata). 'Bhikkhus, I see no other one thing that is so quickly
transformed as the mind' (A 110)—here it is material states that are referred to by the
word 'other' because they do not pass quickly. And in the Abhidhamma only matter
is called prenascence condition and only consciousness postnascence condition. And
wherever states (dhamma) arise, there they dissolve. There is no transmigration to an
adjacent location (desantara-sankamana), nor does the individual essence become other.
For it is not possible to effect any alteration of the characteristics of dhammas by
force of the roads to power. But it is possible to effect alteration of the mode in which
they are present (bhava)" (Vism-mht 397).

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
a created visible form.22 If the possessor of supernormal power walks up and down, the
creation walks up and down there too, etc., all refers to what a disciple creates; but
what the Blessed One creates does whatever the Blessed One does, and it also
does other things according to the Blessed One's pleasure.
136. When this possessor of supernormal power, while remaining here sees a
visible object with the divine eye, hears a sound with the divine ear element,
knows consciousness with the penetration of minds, he does not wield bodily
power in doing that. And when, while remaining here, he stands with that
Brahma, converses, enters into communication with that Brahma, he does not
wield bodily power in doing that. And when he makes his resolve described in
the way beginning "though far, he resolves upon nearness," he does not wield
bodily power in doing that. And when he goes to the Brahma-world with a
visible or an invisible body he does not wield bodily power in doing that. But
when he enters upon the process described in the way beginning, "He creates a
visible form before that Brahma, mind-made," then he wields bodily power in
doing that. The rest, however, is said here for the purpose of showing the stage
prior to the wielding of the bodily power. This, firstly is (i) success bv resolve
(§45).
137.	The difference between (i) success as transformation and (ii) success as
the mind-made [body], is as follows (see §22, 24, 25, 45).
(i) One, firstly who performs a transformation [406] should resolve upon
whatever he chooses from among the things beginning with the appearance of
a boy, described as follows: "He abandons his normal appearance and shows
the appearance of a boy or the appearance of a naga (serpent), or the appearance
of a supanna (winged demon), or the appearance of an asura (demon), or the
appearance of the Ruler [of Gods] (Indra), or the appearance of some [other
sensual-sphere] deity or the appearance of a Brahma, or the appearance of the
sea, or the appearance of a rock, or the appearance of a lion, or the appearance
of a tiger, or the appearance of a leopard, or he shows an elephant, or he shows
a horse, or he shows a chariot, or he shows a foot soldier, or he shows a manifold
military array" (Patis II 210).
138.	And when he resolves he should emerge from the fourth ihana that is the
basis for direct-knowledge and has one of the things beginning with the earth
kasina as its object, and he should advert to his own appearance as a boy. After
adverting and finishing the preliminary work, he should attain again and
emerge, and he should resolve thus: "Let me be a boy of such and such a type."
Simultaneously with the resolve consciousness he becomes the boy, just as
Devadatta did (Vin 1185; Dhp-a 1139). This is the method in all instances. But he
shows an elephant, etc., is said here with respect to showing an elephant, etc.,
externally. Herein, instead of resolving, "Let me be an elephant," he resolves,
"Let there be an elephant." The same method applies in the case of the horse
and the rest.
22. "This should be regarded as implying that there is no sex or life faculty in it either."
(Vism-mht 398).
`399
Chapter XII
The Supernormal Powers
This is success as transformation.
139. (ii) One who wants to make the mind-made [body] should emerge from
the basic jhana and first advert to the body in the wav already described, and
then he should resolve, "Let it be hollow." It becomes hollow Then he adverts to
another body inside it, and having done the preliminary work in the way already
described, he resolves, "Let there be another body inside it." Then he draws it
out like a reed from its sheath, like a sword from its scabbard, like a snake from
its slough. Hence it is said: "Here a bhikkhu creates from this body another
body possessing visible form, mind-made, with all its limbs, lacking no faculty
Just as though a man pulled out a reed from its sheath and thought thus: This
is the sheath; this is the reed; the sheath is one, the reed is another, it was from the
sheath that the reed was pulled out'" (Patis II 210), and so on. And here, just as
the reed, etc., are similar to the sheath, etc., so too the mind-made visible form is
similar to the possessor of supernormal power, and this simile is given in order
to show that.
This is success as the mind-made [body].

[(2) The Divine Ear Element]
1. [407] It is now the turn for the description of the divine ear element. Herein,
and also in the case of the remaining three kinds of direct-knowledge, the
meaning of the passage beginning, "When his concentrated mind ..." (D I 79)
should be understood in the way already stated (XII.13f.); and in each case we
shall onlv comment on what is different. [The text is as follows: "He directs, he
inclines, his mind to the divine ear element. With the divine ear element, which
is purified and surpasses the human, he hears both kinds of sounds, the divine
and the human, those that are far as well as near"(D I 79).]
2.	Herein, with the divine ear element: it is divine here because of its similarity to
the divine; for deities have as the divine ear element the sensitivity that is
produced by kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile,
phlegm, blood, etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because
it is liberated from imperfections. And this ear element consisting in knowledge,
which is produced by the power of this bhikkhu's energy in development, is
similar to that, so it is "divine" because it is similar to the divine. Furthermore, it
is "divine" because it is obtained by means of divine abiding and because it has
divine abiding as its support. And it is an "ear element" (sota-dhatu) in the sense
of hearing (savana) and in the sense of being a soulless [element]. Also it is an
"ear element" because it is like the ear element in its performance of an ear
element's function. With that divine ear element ... he hears ...
Which is purified: which is quite pure through having no imperfection. And
surpasses the human: which in the hearing of sounds surpasses, stands beyond,
the human ear element by surpassing the human environment.
3.	He hears both kinds of sounds: he hears the two kinds of sounds. What two?
The divine and the human: the sounds of deities and of human beings, is what
is meant. This should be understood as partially inclusive. Those that are far as
well as near: what is meant is that he hears sounds that are far off, even in another
world-sphere, and those that are near, even the sounds of the creatures living in
his own body. This should be understood as completely inclusive.
4.	But how is this [divine ear element] aroused? The bhikkhu [408] should
attain jhana as basis for direct-knowledge and emerge. Then, with the
`401
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knozvledges
consciousness belonging to the preliminary-work concentration,1 he should
advert first to the gross sounds in the distance normally within range of hearing:
the sound in the forest of lions, etc., or in the monastery the sound of a gong, the
sound of a drum, the sound of a conch, the sound of recitation by novices and
young bhikkhus reciting with full vigour, the sound of their ordinary talk such
as "What, venerable sir?", "What, friend?", etc., the sound of birds, the sound of
wind, the sound of footsteps, the fizzing sound of boiling water, the sound of
palm leaves drying in the sun, the sound of ants, and so on. Beginning in this
way with quite gross sounds, he should successively advert to more and more
subtle sounds. He should give attention] to the sound sign of the sounds in the
eastern direction, in the western direction, in the northern direction, in the
southern direction, in the upper direction, in the lower direction, in the eastern
intermediate direction, in the western intermediate direction, in the northern
intermediate direction, and in the southern intermediate direction. He should
give attention to the sound sign of gross and of subtle sounds.2
5.	These sounds are evident even to his normal consciousness; but they are
especially evident to his preliminary-work-concentration consciousness. 3 As
he gives his attention to the sound sign in this way [thinking] "Now the divine
ear element will arise," mind-door adverting arises making one of these sounds
its object. When that has ceased, then either four or five impulsions impel, the
first three, or four, of which are of the sense sphere and are called preliminary-
work, access, conformity and change-of-lineage, while the fourth, or the fifth, is
fine-material-sphere absorption consciousness belonging to the fourth jhana.
6.	Herein, it is knowledge arisen together with the absorption consciousness
that is called the divine ear element. After that [absorption has been reached, the
divine ear element] becomes merged in that ear [of knowledge].4 When
consolidating it, he should extend it by delimiting a single finger-breadth thus,
"I will hear sounds within this area," then two finger-breadths, four finger-
breadths, eight finger-breadths, a span, a ratana (= 24 finger-breadths), the interior
--
1.	"With the consciousness belonging to the particular concentration that constitutes
the preliminary work. The meaning is: by means of consciousness concentrated with
the momentary concentration that occurs in the form of the preliminary work for
knowledge of the divine ear element. The occasion of access for the divine ear element
is called preliminary-work consciousness, but that as stated refers to multiple
advertings" (Vism-mht 401).
2.	"The sound sign is the sound itself since it is the cause for the arising of the
knowledge. Or the gross-subtle aspect acquired in the way stated is the sound sign"
(Vism-mht 402).
3.	"This is momentary-concentration consciousness, which owing to the fact that
the preliminary work contingent upon the sound has been performed, occurs in one
who has attained the basic jhana and emerged for the purpose of arousing the divine
ear element" (Vism-mht 402).
4.	"'Becomes merged' is amalgamated with the divine ear element. He is called an
obtainer of divine-ear knowledge as soon as the absorption consciousness has arisen.
The meaning is that there is now no further need of development for the purpose"
(Vism-mht 403).
`402

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
of the room, the veranda, the building, the surrounding walk, the park belonging
to the community, the alms-resort village, the district, and so on up to the [limit of
the] world-sphere, or even more. This is how he should extend it by delimited
stages.
7. One who has reached direct-knowledge in this way hears also by means of
direct-knowledge without re-entering the basic jhana any sound that has come
within the space touched by the basic jhana's object. And in hearing in this way,
even if there is an uproar with sounds of conches, drums, cymbals, etc., right up
to the Brahma-world [409] he can, if he wants to, still define each one thus, "This
is the sound of conches, this is the sound of drums."
The explanation of the divine ear element is ended.
[(3) Penetration of Minds]
8. As to the explanation of knowledge of penetration of minds, [the text is as
follows: "He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of penetration of
minds. He penetrates with his mind the minds of other beings, of other persons,
and understands them thus: he understands [the manner of] consciousness
affected by greed as affected by greed, and understands [the manner of]
consciousness unaffected by greed as unaffected by greed; he understands
consciousness affected by hate as affected by hate, and consciousness unaffected
by hate as unaffected by hate; he understands consciousness affected by delusion
as affected by delusion, and consciousness unaffected by delusion as unaffected
by delusion; he understands cramped consciousness as cramped, and distracted
consciousness as distracted; he understands exalted consciousness as exalted,
and unexalted consciousness as unexalted; he understands surpassed
consciousness as surpassed and unsurpassed consciousness as unsurpassed;
he understands concentrated consciousness as concentrated and unconcentrated
consciousness as unconcentrated; he understands the liberated [manner of]
consciousness as liberated, and the unliberated [manner of] consciousness as
unliberated" (D I 79). Here, it goes all round (pariyati), thus it is penetration
(pariya); the meaning is that it delimits (paricchindati). The penetration of the
heart (cetaso pariyam) is "penetration of minds" (cetopariya). It is penetration of
hearts and that is knowledge, thus it is knowledge of penetration of minds
(icetopariyanana). [He directs his consciousness] to that, is what is meant.
Of other beings: of the rest of beings, himself excluded. Of other persons: this has
the same meaning as the last, the wording being varied to suit those susceptible
of teaching [in another wav], and for the sake of elegance of exposition. With his
mind the minds: with his [manner of] consciousness the [manner of] consciousness
of other beings. Hewing penetrated (paricca): having delimited all round. He
understands: he understands them to be of various sorts beginning with that
affected bv greed.
9. But how is this knowledge to be aroused? That is successfully done through
the divine eye, which constitutes its preliminary work. Therefore the bhikkhu
should extend light, and he should seek out (pariyesitabba) another's [manner
of] consciousness by keeping under observation with the divine eye the colour
`403
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knozvledges
of the blood present with the matter of the physical heart as its support.5 For
when [a manner of] consciousness accompanied by joy is present, the blood is
red like a banyan-fig fruit; when [a manner of] consciousness accompanied by
grief is present, it is blackish like a rose-apple fruit; when [a manner of]
consciousness accompanied by serenity is present, it is clear like sesame oil. So
he should seek out another's [manner of] consciousness by keeping under
observation the colour of the blood in the physical heart thus, "This matter is
originated by the joy faculty; this is originated by the grief faculty; this is
originated by the equanimity faculty," and so consolidate his knowledge of
penetration of hearts.
10. It is when it has been consolidated in this way that he can gradually get to
understand not only all manner of sense-sphere consciousness but those of
fine-material and immaterial consciousness as well by tracing one [manner of]
consciousness from another without any more seeing the physical heart's matter.
For this is said in the Commentary: "When he wants to know another's [manner
of] consciousness in the immaterial modes, whose pliysical-heart matter can he
observe? Whose material alteration [originated] by the faculties can he look at?
No one's. The province of a possessor of supernormal power is [simply] this,
namely wherever the [manner of] consciousness he adverts to is, there he knows
it according to these sixteen classes." But this explanation [by means of the
physical heart] is for one who has not [yet] done any interpreting.6
11. As regards [the manner of\ consciousness affected by greed, etc., the eight
[manners of] consciousness accompanied by greed (see Table III, nos. (22)-(29))
[410] should be understood as [the manner of] consciousness affected by greed.
The remaining profitable and indeterminate [manners of] consciousness in the
four planes are unaffected by greed. The four, namely the two consciousnesses
accompanied by grief (nos. (30) and (31)), and the two consciousnesses
[accompanied respectively by] uncertainty (32) and agitation (33) are not
included in this dyad, though some elders include them too. It is the two
consciousnesses accompanied by grief that are called consciousness affected by
hate. And all profitable and indeterminate consciousnesses in the four planes
are unaffected by hate. The remaining ten kinds of unprofitable consciousnesses
(nos. (22)-(29) and (32) and (33)) are not included in this dyad, though some
elders include them too. Affected by delusion ... unaffected by delusion: here only
the two, namely that accompanied by uncertainty and that accompanied by
agitation, are affected by delusion alone [without being accompanied by the
other two unprofitable roots]. But [all] the twelve kinds of unprofitable
consciousnesses (nos. (22)-(33)) can also be understood as [the manner of]
--
5.	The "matter of the heart" is not the heart-basis, but rather it is the heart as the
piece of flesh described as resembling a lotus bud in shape outside and like a kosataki
fruit inside (VIII.111). For the blood mentioned here is to be found with that as its
support. But the heart-basis occurs with this blood as its support" (Vism-mht 403).
6.	"Of one who has not done any interpreting (abhinivesa) reckoned as study for
direct-knowledge" (Vism-mht 407). A rather special use of the word abhinivesa, perhaps
more freely renderable here as "practice."
`404
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
consciousness affected by delusion since delusion is present in all kinds of
unprofitable consciousnesses. The rest are unaffected by delusion.
12. Cramped is that attended by stiffness and torpor. Distracted is that attended
by agitation. Exalted is that of the fine-material and immaterial spheres. Unexalted
is the rest. Surpassed is all that in the three [mundane] planes. Unsurpassed is the
supramundane. Concentrated is that attained to access and that attained to
absorption. Unconcentrated is that not attained to either. Liberated is that attained
to any [of the five kinds of] deliverance, that is to say, deliverance by substitution
of opposites [through insight], by suppression [through concentration], by
cutting off [bv means of the path], by tranqujillization [bv means of fruition], and
by renunciation [as Nibbana] (see Patis I 26 under "abandoning"). Unliberated
is that which has not attained to anv of the five kinds of liberation.
So the bhikkhu who has acquired the knowledge of penetration of hearts
understands all these [manners of consciousness, namely the manner of]
consciousness arrecteci Dv greea as arrecteci Dy greed ... [tne unliberated manner
of] consciousness as unliberated. 
[(4) Recollection of Past Lives] 
13. As to the explanation of knowledge of recollection of past lives, [the text is
as follows:] He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of recollection of
past lives. He recollects his manifold past lives, that is to say, one birth, two
births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births,
forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand
births, many eons of world contraction, many eons of world expansion: many
eons of world contraction and expansion: "There I was so named, of such a race,
with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure
and pain, such the end of my life span; and passing away from there, I reappeared
elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a race, with such an appearance,
such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my
life span; and passing away from there, I reappeared here." Thus with its aspects
and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives" (D I 81). [Herein,] to the
-1-X---’-■=--
knowledge of recollection of past lives [means] for knowledge concerning
recollection of past lives. Past lilies is aggregates lived in the past in former
births. "Lived" [in that case means] lived out, undergone, arisen and ceased in
one's own [subjective] continuity. Or alternatively, [past lives] is mental objects
lived [in the past in one's former births]; and "lived" in that case means lived by
living in one's [objective] resort, which has been cognized and delimited by
one's own consciousness, or cognized bv another's consciousness, too. In the
case of recollection of those [past Enlightened Ones] who have broken the cycle,
and so on,7 these last are only accessible to Enlightened Ones. Recollection of past
lives: the mindfulness (memory) by means of which he recollects the past lives is
the recollection of past lives. Knowledge is the knowledge associated with that
mindfulness. [411] To the knowledge of recollection of past lives: for the purpose of

7. For the term cliinna-vaturnaka ("one who has broken the cycle of rebirths") as an
epithet of former Buddhas, see M III 118.
`405
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
the knowledge of the recollection of past lives in this way; for the attaining, for
the reaching, of that knowledge, is what is meant.
14.	Manifold: of many kinds: or that has occurred in many ways. Given in
detail, is the meaning.8 Past lives is the continuity lived here and there, taking
the immediately previous existence as the beginning [and working backwards].
He recollects: he recalls it, following it out by the succession of aggregates, or by
death and rebirth-linking.
15.	There are six kinds of people who recollect these past lives. They are: other
sectarians, ordinary disciples, great disciples, chief disciples, Paccekabuddhas,
and Buddhas.
16.	Herein, other sectarians recollect only as far back as forty eons, but not
beyond that. Why? Because their understanding is weak for lack of delimitation
of mind and matter (see Ch. XVIII). Ordinary disciples recollect as far back as a
hundred eons and as far back as a thousand eons because their understanding
is strong. The eighty great disciples recollect as far back as a hundred thousand
eons. The two chief disciples recollect as far back as an incalculable age and a
hundred thousand eons. Paccekabuddhas recollect as far back as two incalculable
ages and a hundred thousand eons. For such is the extent to which they can
convey [their minds back respectively]. But there is no limit in the case of Buddhas.
17. Again, other sectarians only recollect the succession of aggregates; they
are unable to recollect according [only] to death and rebirth-linking, letting go
of the succession of aggregates. They are like the blind in that they are unable to
descend upon any place they choose; they go as the blind do without letting go
of their sticks. So they recollect without letting go of the succession of aggregates.
Ordinary disciples both recollect by means of the succession of aggregates and
trace bv means of death and rebirth-linking. Likewise, the eighty great disciples.
But the chief disciples have nothing to do with the succession of aggregates.
When they see the death of one person, they see the rebirth-linking, and again
when they see the death of another, they see the rebirth-linking. So they go by
tracing through death and rebirth-thinking. Likewise, Paccekabuddhas.
18. Buddhas, however, have nothing to do either with succession of aggregates
or with tracing through death and rebirth-linking; for whatever instance they
choose in many millions of eons, or more or less, is evident to them. So they go,
and so they descend with the lion's descent9 wherever they want, even skipping
over many millions of eons as though they were an elision in a text. And just as
an arrow shot by such a master of archery expert in hair-splitting as Sarabhariga
(see J-a V 129) always hits the target without getting held up among trees,
creepers, etc., on its way and so neither gets held up nor misses, so too, since
Buddhas go in this way their knowledge does not get held up in intermediate

Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
births [412] or miss; without getting held up or missing, it seizes any instance
required.
19.	Among these beings with recollection of past lives, the sectarians' vision
of past lives seems like the light of a glow-worm, that of ordinary disciples like
the light of a candle, that of the great disciples like the light of a torch, that of the
chief disciples like the light of the morning star, that of Paccekabuddhas like the
light of the moon, and that of Buddhas like the glorious autumn sun's disk with
its thousand rays.
20.	Other sectarians see past lives as blind men go [tapping] with the point of
a stick. Ordinary disciples do so as men who go on a log bridge. The great
disciples do so as men who go on a foot bridge. The chief disciples do so as men
who go on a cart bridge. Paccekabuddhas do so as men who go on a main foot-
path. And Buddhas do so as men who go on a high road for carts.
21.	In this connection it is the disciples' recollection of past lives that is intended.
Hence it was said above: "'He recollects': he recollects it following it out by the
succession of aggregates, or bv death and rebirth-linking" (§14).
22. So a bhikkhu who is a beginner and wants to recollect in this way should
go into solitary retreat on return from his alms round after his meal. Then he
should attain the four jhanas in succession and emerge from the fourth jhana as
basis for direct-knowledge. He should then advert to his most recent act of
sitting down [for this purpose], next, to the preparation of the seat, to the entry
into the lodging, to the putting away of the bowl and [outer] robe, to the time of
eating, to the time of returning from the village, to the time of wandering for alms
in the village, to the time of entering the village, to the time of setting out from the
monastery, to the time of paying homage at the shrine terrace and the
Enlightenment-tree terrace, to the time of washing the bowl, to the time of picking
up the bowl, to the things done from the time of picking up the bowl back to the
mouth washing, to the things done in the early morning, to the things done in
the middle watch, in the first watch. In this way he should advert to all the things
done during the whole night and day in reverse order.
23.	While this much, however, is evident even to his normal consciousness, it is
especially evident to his preliminary-work consciousness. But if anything there
is not evident, he should again attain the basic jhana, emerge and advert. By so
doing it becomes as evident as when a lamp is lit. And so, in reverse order too, he
should advert to the things done on the second day back, and on the third,
fourth and fifth day, and in the ten days, and in the fortnight, and as far back as
a year.
24.	When by these means he adverts to ten years, twenty years, and so on as far
back as his own rebirth-linking in this existence, [413] he should advert to the
mentality-materialitv occurring at the moment of death in the preceding existence;
for a wise bhikkhu is able at the first attempt to remove10 the rebirth-linking and
make the mentality-materiality at the death moment his object.
--
10. Uggliatetva: see X.6; the word is obviously used here in the same sense.
`407
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knozvledges
25.	But the mentality-materiality in the previous existence has ceased without
remainder and another has arisen, and consequently that instance is, as it were,
shut away in darkness, and it is hard for one of little understanding to see it. Still
he should not give up the task, thinking, "I am unable to remove the rebirth-
linking and make the mentality-materiality that occurred at the death moment
my object." On the contrary, he should again and again attain that same basic
jhana, and each time he emerges he should advert to that instance.
26.	Just as when a strong man is felling a big tree for the purpose of making
the peak of a gable, but is unable to fell the big tree with an axe blade blunted by
lopping the branches and foliage, still he does not give up the task; on the
contrary he goes to a smithy and has his axe sharpened, after which he returns
and continues chopping the tree; and when the axe again gets blunt, he does as
before and continues chopping it; and as he goes on chopping it in this way, the
tree falls at length, because each time there is no need to chop again what has
already been chopped and what has not yet been chopped gets chopped; so too,
when he emerges from the basic jhana, instead of adverting to what he has
already adverted to, he should advert only to the rebirth-linking, and at length
he removes the rebirth-linking and makes the mentality-materiality that occurred
at the death moment his object. And this meaning should also be illustrated by
means of the wood cutter and the hair-cutter as well.
27. Herein, the knowledge that occurs making its object the period from the
last sitting down for this purpose back to the rebirth-linking is not called
knowledge of recollection of past lives; but it is called preliminary-work -
concentration knowledge; and some call it "knowledge of the past" (atltamsa-
nana), but that is inappropriate to the fine-material sphere.
However, when this bhikkhu has got back beyond the rebirth-linking, there
arises in him mind-door adverting making its object the mentality-materiality
that occurred at the death moment. And when that has ceased, then either four or
five impulsions impel making that their object too. The first of these, called
"preliminary-work," etc., in the way already described (§5), are of the sense
sphere. The last is a fine-material absorption consciousness of the fourth jhana.
The knowledge that arises in him then together with that consciousness is what
is called, "knowledge of recollection of past lives." It is with the mindfulness
(memory) associated with that knowledge that he "recollects his manifold past
lives, that is to say, one birth, two births, ..."[414] thus with details and particulars
he recollects his manifold past lives (D I 81).
28.	Herein, one birth is the continuity of aggregates included in a single
becoming starting with rebirth-linking and ending with death. So too with two
births, and the rest.
But in the case of many eons of world contraction, etc., it should be understood
that the aeon of world contraction is an aeon of diminution and the aeon of
world expansion is an aeon of increase.
29.	Herein, what supersedes the contraction is included in the contraction
since it is rooted in it; and so too what supersedes the expansion is included in
the expansion. This being so, it includes what is stated thus: "Bhikkhus, there
`408
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
are four incalculables of the aeon. What four? The contraction, what supersedes
the contraction, the expansion, and what supersedes the expansion" (A II 142
abbreviated).
30.	Herein, there are three kinds of contraction: contraction due to water,
contraction due to fire, and contraction due to air (see MN 28). Also there are
three limits to the contraction; the Abhassara (Streaming-radiance) Brahma-
world, that of the Subhakinha (Refulgent-glory), and that of the Vehapphala
(Great-fruit). When the aeon contracts owing to fire, all below the Abhassara
[Brahma-world] is burnt up by fire. When it contracts owing to water, it is all
dissolved by water up to the Subhakinha [Brahma-world]. When it contracts
owing to air, it is all demolished by wind up to the Vehapphala [Brahma-world].
31.	In breadth it is always one of the Buddha-fields that is destroyed. For the
Buddha-fields are of three kinds, that is, the field of birth, the field of authority
and the field of scope.
Herein, the field of birth is limited by the ten thousand world-spheres that
quaked on the Perfect One's taking rebirth-linking, and so on. The field of
authority is limited by the hundred thousand million world-spheres where the
following safeguards (partita) are efficacious, that is, the Ratana Sutta (Sn p.39),
the Khandha Paritta (Vin II 109; A II 72), the Dhajagga Paritta (S I 218), the
Atanatiya Paritta (D III 194), and the Mora Paritta (J-a II 33). The field of scope is
boundless, immeasurable: "As far as he wishes" (A I 228), it is said. The Perfect
One knows anything anywhere that he wishes. So one of these three Buddha-
fields, that is to say, the field of authority is destroyed. But when that is being
destroyed, the field of birth also gets destroyed. And that happens simultaneously;
and when it is reconstituted, that happens simultaneously (cf. M-a IV 114).
32. Now, it should be understood how its destruction and reconstitution come
about thus. On the occasion when the aeon is destroyed by fire [415] first of all a
great cloud heralding the aeon's destruction appears, and there is a great
downpour all over the hundred thousand million world-spheres. People are
delighted, and they bring out all their seeds and sow them. But when the sprouts
have grown enough for an ox to graze, then not a drop of rain falls any more
even when the asses bray. Rain is withheld from then on. This is what the
Blessed One referred to when he said: "Bhikkhus, an occasion comes when for
many years, for many hundreds of years, for many thousands of years, for many
hundreds of thousands of years, there is no rain" (A IV 100). Beings that live by
rain die and are reborn in the Brahma-world, and so are the deities that live on
flowers and fruits.
33. When a long period has passed in this way the water gives out here and
there. Then in due course the fishes and turtles die and are reborn in the Brahma-
world, and so are the beings in hell. Some say that the denizens of hell perish
there with the appearance of the seventh sun (§41).
Now, there is no rebirth in the Brahma-world without jhana; and some of
them, being obsessed with the scarcity of food, are unable to attain jhana, so how
are they reborn there? Bv means of jhana obtained in the [sense-sphere] divine
world.
`409
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
34.	For then the sense-sphere deities called world-marslial (loka-byuha) deities
come to know that at the end of a hundred thousand years there will be the
emergence of an aeon, and they travel up and down the haunts of men, their
heads bared, their hair dishevelled, with piteous faces, mopping their tears with
their hands, clothed in dved cloth, and wearing their dress in great disorder.
They make this announcement: "Good sirs, good sirs, at the end of a hundred
thousand years from now there will be the emergence of an aeon. This world
will be destroyed. Even the ocean will dry up. This great earth, and the Sineru
King of Mountains, will be consumed and destroyed. The destruction of the
earth will extend as far as the Brahma-world. Develop loving-kindness, good
sirs, develop compassion, gladness, equanimity good sirs. Care for your mothers,
care for your fathers, honour the elders of your clans."
35.	When human beings and earth deities hear their words, thev mostly are
filled with a sense of urgency They become kind to each other and make merit
with loving-kindness, etc., and so they are reborn in the divine world. There they
eat divine food, and they do the preliminary work on the air kasina and acquire
jhana. Others, however, are reborn in a [sense-sphere] divine world through
kamma to be experienced in a future life. For there is no being traversing the
round of rebirths who is destitute of kamma to be experienced in a future life.
They too acquire jhana there in the same way. [416] All are eventually reborn in
the Brahma-world by acquiring jhana in a [sense-sphere] divine world in this
way.
36. However, at the end of a long period after the withholding of the rain, a
second sun appears. And this is described by the Blessed One in the way
beginning, "Bhikkhus, there is the occasion when ..." (A IV 100), and the
Sattasuriya Sutta should be given in full. Now, when that has appeared, there is
no more telling night from day; as one sun sets, the other rises. The world is
uninterruptedly scorched by the suns. But there is no sun deity in the aeon-
destruction sun as there is in the ordinary sun.11 Now, when the ordinary sun is
present, thunder clouds and mare's-tail vapours cross the skies. But when the
aeon-destruction sun is present, the sky is as blank as the disk of a looking-
glass and destitute of clouds and vapour. Beginning with the rivulet, the water
in all the rivers except the five great rivers12 dries up.
37.	After that, at the end of a long period, a third sun appears. And when that
has appeared, the great rivers drv up too.
38.	After that, at the end of a long period, a fourth sun appears. And when that
--
has appeared, the seven great lakes in Himalaya, the sources of the great rivers,
11.	"The 'ordinary sun' is the sun's divine palace that arose before the emergence of
the aeon. But like the other sense-sphere deities at the time of the emergence of the
aeon, the sun deity too produces jhana and reappears in the Brahma-world. But the
actual sun's disk becomes brighter and more fiery. Others say that it disappears and
another appears in its place" (Vism-mht 412).
12.	The five are the Ganges, Yamuna (Jumma), Sarabhu, Sarassati, and Mahl
(Vism-mht 412).
`410
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
dry up, that is to say: Sihapapata, Hamsapatana,13 Kannamundaka, Rathakara,
Anotatta, Chaddanta, and Kunala.
39.	After that, at the end of a long period, a fifth sun appears, and when that
has appeared, there eventually comes to be not enough water left in the great
ocean to wet one finger joint.
40.	After that, at the end of a long period, a sixth sun appears, and when that
has appeared, the whole world-sphere becomes nothing but vapour, all its
moisture being evaporated.
And the hundred thousand million world-spheres are the same as this one.
41.	After that, at the end of a long period, a seventh sun appears. And when
that has appeared, the whole world-sphere together with the hundred thousand
million other world-spheres catches fire. Even the summits of Sineru, a hundred
leagues and more high, crumble and vanish into space. The conflagration mounts
up and invades the realm of the Four Kings. When it has burnt up all the golden
palaces, the jewelled palaces and the crystal palaces there, it invades the Realm
of the Thirty-three. And so it goes right on up to the plane of the first jhana.
When it has burnt three [lower] Brahma-worlds, it stops there at the Abliassara-
world. [417] As long as any formed thing (formation) the size of an atom still
exists it does not go out; but it goes out when all formed things have been
consumed. And like the flame that burns ghee and oil, it leaves no ash.
42.	The upper space is now all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy
darkness. Then at the end of a long period a great cloud arises, and at first it
rains gently and then it rains with ever heavier deluges, like lotus stems, like
rods, like pestles, like palm trunks, more and more. And so it pours down upon
all burnt areas in the hundred thousand million world-spheres till they
disappear. Then the winds (forces) beneath and all around that water rise up
and compact it and round it, like water drops on a lotus leaf. How do they
compact the great mass of water? By making gaps; for the wind makes gaps in
it here and there.
43.	Being thus compressed bv the air, compacted and reduced, it gradually
subsides. As it sinks, the [lower] Brahma-world reappears in its place, and worlds
divine reappear in the places of the four upper divine worlds of the sensual
sphere.14 But when it has sunk to the former earth's level, strong winds (forces)
arise and they stop it and hold it stationary like the water in a water pot when the
outlet is plugged. As the fresh water gets used up, the essential humus makes its
appearance on it. That possesses colour, smell and taste, like the surface film on
milk rice when it dries up.
44. Then the beings that were reborn first in the Brahma-world of Streaming-
radiance (Abhassara) fall from there with the exhaustion of their life span, or
13.	Hmnsapatana is another name for Mandakim. (Vism-mht) For seven Great Lakes
see A IV 101.
14.	"At the place where the Yama Deities are established. The places where the
Catumaharajika and Tavatimsa heavens become established do not reappear at first
because they are connected with the earth" (Vism-mht 412).
`411
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
when their merit is exhausted, and they reappear here. They are self-luminous
and wander in the sky. On eating the essential humus, as is told in the Agganna
Sutta (D III 85), they are overcome by craving, and they busy themselves in
making lumps of it to eat. Then their self-luminosity vanishes, and it is dark.
They are frightened when they see the darkness.
45.	Then in order to remove their fears and give them courage, the sun's disk
appears full fifty leagues across. They are delighted to see it, thinking, "We have
light," and they say, "It has appeared in order to allay our fears and give us
courage (surabhava), so let it be called 'sun' (suriya)./f So they give it the name
"sun" (suriya). Now, when the sun has given light for a day it sets. Then thev are
frightened again, thinking, "We have lost the light we had," and they think,
"How good if we had another light!" [418]
46.	As if knowing their thought, the moon's disk appears, forty-nine leagues
across. On seeing it they are still more delighted, and they say, "It has appeared,
seeming as if it knew our desire (chanda), so let it be called 'moon' (canda)." So
they give it the name "moon" (canda).
47.	After the appearance of the moon and sun in this way, the stars appear in
their constellations. After that, night and day are made known, and in due
course, the month and half month, the season, and the year.
48.	On the day the moon and sun appear, the mountains of Sineru, of the
World-sphere and of Himalaya appear too. And they appear on the full-moon
day of the month of Phagguna (March), neither before nor after. How? Just as,
when millet is cooking and bubbles arise, then simultaneously some parts are
domes, some hollow, and some flat, so too, there are mountains in the domed
places, seas in the hollow places, and continents (islands) in the flat places.
49.	Then, as these beings make use of the essential humus, gradually some
become handsome and some ugly. The handsome ones despise the ugly ones.
Owing to their contempt the essential humus vanishes and an outgrowth from
the soil appears. Then that vanishes in the same way and the badalata creeper
appears. That too vanishes in the same way and the rice without red powder or
husk that ripens without tilling appears, a clean sweet-smelling rice fruit.
50.	Then vessels appear. These beings put the rice into the vessels, which they
put on the tops of stones. A flame appears spontaneously and cooks it. The
cooked rice resembles jasmine flowers. It has no need of sauces and curries, since
it has whatever flavour they want to taste.
51.	As soon as they eat this gross food, urine and excrement appear in them.
Then wound orifices break open in them to let these things out. The male sex
appears in the male, and the female sex in the female. Then the females brood
over the males, and the males over the females for a long time. Owing to this long
period of brooding, the fever of sense desires arises. After that they practice
sexual intercourse.
52.	[419] For their [overt] practice of evil they are censured and punished by
the wise, and so they build houses for the purpose of concealing the evil. When
they live in houses, they eventually fall in with the views of the more lazy, and
`412
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
they make stores of food. As soon as they do that, the rice becomes enclosed in
red powder and husks and no longer grows again of itself in the place where it
was reaped. They meet together and bemoan the fact, "Evil has surely made its
appearance among beings; for formerly we were mind-made ..." (D III 90), and
all this should be given in full in the way described in the Agganna Sutta.
53.	After that, they set up boundaries. Then some being takes a portion given
to another. After he has been twice rebuked, at the third time thev come to blows
with fists, clods, sticks, and so on. When stealing, censuring, lying, resorting to
sticks, etc., have appeared in this way they meet together, thinking, "Suppose we
elect a being who would reprove those who should be reproved, censure those
who should be censured, and banish those who should be banished, and
suppose we keep him supplied with a portion of the rice?" (D III 92).
54.	When beings had come to an agreement in this way in this aeon, firstly
this Blessed One himself, who was then the Bodhisatta (Being due to be
Enlightened), was the handsomest, the most comely, the most honourable, and
was clever and capable of exercising the effort of restraint. They approached
him, asked him, and elected him. Since he was recognized (sammata) by the
majority (maha-jana) he was called Maha Sammata. Since he was lord of the
fields (khetta) he was called kliattiya (warrior noble). Since he promoted others'
good (ranjeti) righteously and equitably he was a king (raja). This is how he
came to be known by these names. For the Bodhisatta himself is the first man
concerned in any wonderful innovation in the world. So after the khattiva circle
had been established by making the Bodhisatta the first in this way, the brahmans
and the other castes were founded in due succession.
55. Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeon's
destruction up till the ceasing of the flames constitutes one incalculable, and
that is called the "contraction." That from the ceasing of the flames of the aeon
destruction up till the great cloud of rehabilitation, which rains down upon the
hundred thousand million world-spheres, constitutes the second incalculable,
and that is called, "what supersedes the contraction." That from the time of the
great cloud of rehabilitation up till the appearance of the moon and sun
constitutes the third incalculable, and that is called the "expansion." That from
the appearance of the moon and sun up till [420] the reappearance of the great
cloud of the aeon destruction is the fourth incalculable, and that is called, "what
supersedes the expansion." These four incalculables make up one great aeon.
This, firstly, is how the destruction by fire and reconstitution should be
understood.
56.	The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by water should be treated in the
way already described beginning, "First of all a great cloud heralding the aeon's
destruction appears ..." (§32).
57.	There is this difference, however. While in the former case a second sun
--
appeared, in this case a great cloud of caustic waters15 appears. At first it rains
15. Klianidaka—"caustic waters": the name given to the waters on which the world-
spheres rest (see M-a IV 178).
`413
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
very gently but it goes on to rain with gradually greater deluges, pouring down
upon the hundred thousand million world-spheres. As soon as thev are touched
by the caustic waters, the earth, the mountains, etc., melt away, and the waters are
supported all round by winds. The waters take possession from the earth up to
the plane of the second jhana. When they have dissolved away the three Brahma-
worlds there, they stop at the Subhakinha-world. As long as any formed thing
the size of an atom exists they do not subside; but they suddenly subside and
vanish away when all formed things have been overwhelmed by them. All
beginning with: "The upper space is all one with the lower space in a vast
gloomy darkness ..." (§42) is as already described, except that here the world
begins its reappearance with the Abhassara Brahma-wo rid. And beings falling
from the Subhakinha Brahma-world are reborn in the places beginning with the
Abhassara Brahma-world.
58. Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeon's
destruction up till the ceasing of the aeon-destroying waters constitutes one
I	CT7-O
incalculable. That from the ceasing of the waters up till the great cloud of
rehabilitation constitutes the second incalculable. That from the great cloud of
rehabilitation ... These four incalculables make up one great aeon. This is how
the destruction by water and reconstitution should be understood.
59.	The occasion when the aeon is destroyed by air should be treated in the
way already described beginning with the "first of all a great cloud heralding
the aeon's destruction appears ..." (§32).
60.	There is this difference, however. While in the first case there was a second
sun, here a wind arises in order to destroy the aeon. First of all it lifts up the
coarse flue, then the fine flue, then the fine sand, coarse sand, gravel, stones, etc.,
[421] until it lifts up stones as big as a catafalque,16 and great trees standing in
uneven places. They are swept from the earth up into the sky and instead of
falling down again they are broken to bits there and cease to exist.
61.	Then eventually wind arises from underneath the great earth and overturns
the earth, flinging it into space. The earth splits into fragments measuring a
hundred leagues, measuring two, three, four, five hundred leagues, and they are
hurled into space too, and there they are broken to bits and cease to exist. The
world-sphere mountains and Mount Sineru are wrenched up and cast into
space, where they crash against each other till they are broken to bits and
disappear. In this way it destroys the divine palaces built on the earth [of Mount
Sineru] and those built in space, it destroys the six sensual-sphere divine worlds,
and it destroys the hundred thousand million world-spheres. Then world-sphere
collides with world-sphere, Himalaya Mountain with Himalaya Mountain,
Sineru with Sineru, till they are broken to bits and disappear.
62. The wind takes possession from the earth up to the plane of the third
jhana. There, after destroying three Brahma-worlds, it stops at the Vehapphala-
world. When it has destroyed all formed things in this way, it spends itself too.
16. Kutagara: see Ch. XII, n.14; here this seems the most likely of the various meanings
of the word.
`414
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
Then all happens as already described in the way beginning, "The upper space
is all one with the lower space in a vast gloomy darkness ..." (§42). But here the
world begins its reappearance with the Subhakinha Brahma-world. And beings
falling from the Vehapphala Brahma-world are reborn in the places beginning
with the Subhakinha Brahma-world.
63.	Herein, the period from the time of the great cloud heralding the aeon's
destruction up till the ceasing of the aeon-destroying wind is one incalculable.
That from the ceasing of the wind up till the great cloud of rehabilitation is the
second incalculable ... These four incalculables make up one great aeon. This is
how the destruction by wind and reconstitution should be understood.
64.	What is the reason for the world's destruction in this way? The [three] roots
of the unprofitable are the reason. When any one of the roots of the unprofitable
becomes conspicuous, the world is destroyed accordingly. When greed is more
conspicuous, it is destroyed by fire. When hate is more conspicuous, it is destroyed
by water—though some say that it is destroyed by fire when hate is more
conspicuous and by water when greed is more conspicuous. And when delusion
is more conspicuous, it is destroyed by wind.
65.	Destroyed as it is in this way it is destroyed for seven turns in succession by
fire and the eighth turn by water; then again seven turns by fire and the eighth
turn by water; then, when it has been seven times destroyed by water at each
eighth [422] turn, it is again destroyed for seven turns by fire. Sixty-three eons
pass in this way. And now the air takes the opportunity to usurp the water's turn
for destruction, and in destroying the world it demolishes the Subhakinha
Brahma-world where the life span is the full sixty-four eons.
66.	Now, when a bhikkhu capable of recollecting eons is recollecting his former
lives, then of such eons as these he recollects many eons of world contraction, many
eons of world expansion, many eons of world contraction and expansion. How? In the
way beginning, There I was ...
Herein, There I was: in that eon of contraction I was in that kind of becoming
or generation or destiny or station of consciousness or abode of beings or order
of beings.
67.	So named: [such forenames as] Tissa, say, or Phussa. Of such a race: [such
family names as] Kaccana, say or Kassapa. This is said of the recollection of his
own name and race (surname) in his past existence. But if he wants to recollect
his own appearance at that time, or whether his life was a rough or refined one,
or whether pleasure or pain was prevalent, or whether his life span was short or
long, he recollects that too. Hence he said with such an appearance ... such the end
of my life span.
68.	Here, with such an appearance means fair or dark. Such was my food: with
white rice and meat dishes as food or with windfall fruits as food. Such my
experience of pleasure and pain: with varied experience of bodily and mental
pleasure and pain classed as worldly and unworldly, and so on. Such the end of
my life span: with such a life span of a century or life span of eighty-four thousand
eons.
`415
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
69.	And passing away from there; I reappeared elsewhere: having passed awav
from that becoming, generation, destiny station of consciousness, abode of beings
or order of beings, I again appeared in that other becoming, generation, destiny
station of consciousness, abode of beings or order of beings. And there too I was:
then again I was there in that becoming, generation, destiny, station of
consciousness, abode of beings or order of beings. So named, etc., are as already
stated.
70.	Furthermore, the words there I was refer to the recollection of one who has
cast back retrospectively as far as he wishes, and the words and passing away
from there refer to his reviewing after turning forward again; consequently the
words I appeared elsewhere can be understood to be said with reference to the
place of his reappearance next before his appearance here, which is referred to
by the words I appeared here. But the words there too I was, etc., [423] are said in
order to show the recollection of his name, race, etc., there in the place of his
reappearance next before this appearance. And passing away from there, I reappeared
here: having passed away from that next place of reappearance, I was reborn here
in this kliattiya clan or brahman clan.
71.	Thus: so. With its aspects and particulars: with its particulars consisting in
name and race; with its aspects consisting in appearance, and so on. For it is by
means of name and race that a being is particularized as, say Tissa Kassapa; but
his distinctive personality is made known by means of appearance, etc., as dark
or fair. So the name and race are the particulars, while the others are the aspects.
He recollects his manifold past lives: the meaning of this is clear.
The explanation of the knowledge of recollection of past lives is ended.
[(5) The Divine Eye—Knowledge of Passing Away and
Reappearance of Beings]
72.	As to the explanation of the knowledge of passing away and reappearance
of beings, [here is the text: "He directs, he inclines, his mind to the knowledge of
the passing away and reappearance of beings. With the divine eve, which is
purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their
destiny; he understands beings as faring according to their deeds: These worthy
beings who were ill-conducted in body speech and mind, revilers of Noble
Ones, wrong in their views, acquirers of kamma due to wrong view, have, on the
breakup of the body after death, appeared in a state of loss, in an unhappy
destiny in perdition in hell; but these worthy beings, who are well conducted in
body speech and mind, not revilers of Noble Ones, right in their views, acquirers
of kamma due to right view, have, on the breakup of the body after death, appeared
in a happy destiny in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is
purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and
reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, happy or unhappy in their
destiny; he understands beings as faring according to their deeds" (D I 82).
Herein,] to the knowledge of the passing away and reappearance: cutupapatananaya=
cutiya ca upapate ca nanaya (resolution of compound); [the meaning is,] for the
`416
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
kind of knowledge bv means of which beings' passing away and reappearance
is known; for knowledge of the divine eye, is what is meant. He directs; he inclines
his mind: he both directs and inclines preliminary-work consciousness. He is
the bhikkhu who does the directing of his mind.
73. But as regards with the divine eye, etc., it is divine because of its similarity to
the divine; for deities have as divine eye the sensitivity that is produced by
kamma consisting in good conduct and is unimpeded by bile, phlegm, blood,
etc., and capable of receiving an object even though far off because it is liberated
from imperfections. And this eye, consisting in knowledge, which is produced
by the power of this bhikkhu's energy in development, is similar to that, so it is
"divine" because it is similar to the divine. Also it is "divine" because it is
obtained by means of divine abiding, and because it has divine abiding as its
support. And it is "divine" because it greatlv illuminates by discerning light.
And it is "divine" because it has a great range through seeing visible objects
that are behind walls, and so on. All that should be understood according to the
science of grammar. It is an eye in the sense of seeing. Also it is an eye since it is
like an eye in its performance of an eye's function. It is purified since it is a cause
of purification of view, owing to seeing passing away and reappearance.
74.	One who sees only passing away and not reappearance assumes the
annihilation view; and one who sees onlv reappearance and not passing away
assumes the view that a new being appears. But since one who sees both outstrips
that twofold [false] view, that vision of his is therefore a cause for purification of
view. And the Buddhas' sons see both of these. Hence it was said above: [424] "It
is 'purified' since it is a cause of purification of view, owing to seeing passing
away and reappearance."
75.	It surpasses the human in the seeing of visible objects by surpassing the
human environment. Or it can be understood that it surpasses the human in
surpassing the human fleshly eye. With that divine eye, which is purified and
superhuman, he sees beings, he watches beings as men do with the fleshly eye.
76.	Passing away and reappearing: he cannot see them with the divine eve actually
at the death moment of reappearance.17 But it is those who, being on the verge of
death, will die now that are intended as "passing away" and those who have
taken rebirth-linking and have just reappeared that are intended by
--
17. "'He cannot see them with the divine eye'—with the knowledge of the divine eye—
because of the extreme brevity and extreme subtlety of the material moment in
anyone. Moreover, it is present materiality that is the object of the divine eye, and that
is by prenascence condition. And there is no occurrence of exalted consciousness
without adverting and preliminary work. Nor is materiality that is only arising able to
serve as object condition, nor that which is dissolving. Therefore, it is rightly said that
he cannot see with the divine eye materiality at the moments of death and reappearance.
If the knowledge of the divine eye has only materiality as its object, then why is it said
that he 'sees beings'? It is said in this way since it is mainly concerned with instances
of materiality in a being's continuity, or because that materiality is a reason for
apprehending beings. Some say that this is said according to conventional usage"
(Vism-mht 417).

"reappearing." What is pointed out is that he sees them as such passing awav
and reappearing.
77.	Inferior: despised, disdained, looked down upon, scorned, on account of
birth, clan, wealth, etc., because of reaping the outcome of delusion. Superior: the
opposite of that because of reaping the outcome of non-delusion. Fair: having a
desirable, agreeable, pleasing appearance because of reaping the outcome of
non-hate. Ugly: having undesirable, disagreeable, unpleasing appearance
because of reaping the outcome of hate; unsightly, ill-favoured, is the meaning.
Happy in their destiny: gone to a happy destiny; or rich, very wealthy, because of
reaping the outcome of non-greed. Unhappy in their destiny: gone to an unhappy
destiny; or poor with little food and drink because of reaping the outcome of
greed.
78.	Faring according to their deeds: moving on in accordance with whatever deeds
(kamma) may have been accumulated. Herein, the function of the divine eye is
described by the first expressions beginning with "passing away." But the
function of knowledge of faring according to deeds is described by this last
expression.
79.	The order in which that knowledge arises is this. Here a bhikkhu extends
light downwards in the direction of hell, and he sees beings in hell undergoing
great suffering. That vision is only the divine eye's function. He gives it attention
in this way, "After doing what deeds do these beings undergo this suffering?"
Then knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this way "It
was after doing this." Likewise he extends light upwards in the direction of the
[sensual-sphere] divine world, and he sees beings in the Nandana Grove, the
Missaka Grove, the Pharusaka Grove, etc., enjoying great good fortune. That
vision also is only the divine eve's function. He gives attention to it in this way
"After doing what deeds do these beings enjoy this good fortune?" Then
knowledge that has those deeds as its object arises in him in this wav, "It was
after doing this." This is what is called knowledge of faring according to deeds.
80.	There is no special preliminary work for this. And as in this case, so too in
the case of knowledge of the future; for these have the divine eye as their basis
and their success is dependent on that of the divine eye. [425]
81.	As to ill-conducted in body, etc., it is bad conduct (dutthu caritam), or it is
corrupted conduct (duttham caritam) because it is rotten with defilements, thus it
is ill-conduct (duccarita). The ill-conduct comes about by means of the bodv, or
the ill-conduct has arisen due to the body, thus it is ill-conduct in body; so too
with the rest. Ill-conducted is endowed with ill-conduct.
82.	Revilers of Noble Ones: being desirous of harm for Noble Ones consisting of
Buddhas, Paccekabuddhas, and disciples, and also of householders who are
stream-enterers, they revile them with the worst accusations or with denial of
their special qualities (see Ud 44 and MN 12); they abuse and upbraid them, is
what is meant.
83.	Herein, it should be understood that when they say, "They have no
asceticism, they are not ascetics," they revile them with the worst accusation;
`418
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
and when they say "They have no jhana or liberation or path of fruition, etc.,"
they revile them with denial of their special qualities. And whether done
knowingly or unknowingly it is in either case reviling of Noble Ones; it is weighty
kamma resembling that of immediate result, and it is an obstacle both to heaven
and to the path. But it is remediable.
84. The following story should be understood in order to make this clear. An
elder and a young bhikkhu, it seems, wandered for alms in a certain village. At
the first house they got only a spoonful of hot gruel. The elder's stomach was
paining him with wind. He thought, "This gruel is good for me; I shall drink it
before it gets cold." People brought a wooden stool to the doorstep, and he sat
down and drank it. The other was disgusted and remarked, "The old man has
let his hunger get the better of him and has done what he should be ashamed to
do." The elder wandered for alms, and on returning to the monastery he asked
the young bhikkhu, "Have you any footing in this Dispensation, friend?"—
"Yes, venerable sir, I am a stream-enterer."—"Then, friend, do not try for the
higher paths; one whose cankers are destroyed has been reviled by you." The
young bhikkhu asked for the elder's forgiveness and was thereby restored to his
former state.
85.	So one who reviles a Noble One, even if he is one himself, should go to him;
if he himself is senior, [426] he should sit down in the squatting position and get
his forgiveness in this way, "I have said such and such to the venerable one; may
he forgive me." If he himself is junior, he should pay homage, and sitting in the
squatting position and holding out his hand palms together, he should get his
forgiveness in this way "I have said such and such to you, venerable sir; forgive
me." If the other has gone away he should get his forgiveness either by going to
him himself or bv sending someone such as a co-resident.
86.	If he can neither go nor send, he should go to the bhikkhus who live in that
monastery and, sitting down in the squatting position if they are junior, or
acting in the way already described if they are senior, he should get forgiveness
by saying, "Venerable sirs, I have said such and such to the venerable one named
so and so; mav that venerable one forgive me." And this should also be done
when he fails to get forgiveness in his presence.
87.	If it is a bhikkhu who wanders alone and it cannot be discovered where he
is living or where he has gone, he should go to a wise bhikkhu and say, "Venerable
sir, I have said such and such to the venerable one named so and so. When I
remember it, I am remorseful. What shall I do?" He should be told, "Think no
more about it; the elder forgives you. Set your mind at rest." Then he should
extend his hands palms together in the direction taken by the Noble One and
say "Forgive me."
88.	If the Noble One has attained the final Nibbana, he should go to the place
where the bed is, on which he attained the final Nibbana, and should go as far
as the charnel ground to ask forgiveness. When this has been done, there is no
obstruction either to heaven or to the path. He becomes as he was before.
89.	Wrong in their views: having distorted vision. Acquirers of kamma due to
wrong view: those who have kamma of the various kinds acquired through wrong
`419
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
view, and also those who incite others to bodily kamma, etc., rooted in wrong
view. And here, though reviling of Noble Ones has already been included by the
mention of verbal misconduct, and though wrong view has already been
included by the mention of mental misconduct, it may be understood,
nevertheless, that the two are mentioned again in order to emphasize their great
reprehensibility
90. Reviling Noble Ones is greatly reprehensible because of its resemblance to
kamma with immediate result. For this is said: "Sariputta, just as a bhikkhu
possessing virtuous conduct, concentration and understanding could here and
now attain final knowledge, so it is in this case, I say; if he does not abandon
such talk and such thoughts and renounce such views, he will find himself in
hell as surely as if he had been carried off and put there" (M I 71).18 [427] And
there is nothing more reprehensible than wrong view, according as it is said:
"Bhikkhus, I do not see any one thing so reprehensible as wrong view" (A I 33).
91.	On the breakup of the body: on the giving up of the clung-to aggregates.
After death: in the taking up of the aggregates generated next after that. Or
alternatively on the breakup of the body is on the interruption of the life faculty,
and after death is beyond the death consciousness.
92.	A state of loss and the rest are all only synonyms for hell. Hell is a state of loss
(apaya) because it is removed (apeta) from the reason (aya)19 known as merit,
which is the cause of [attaining] heaven and deliverance; or because of the absence
(abhava) of any origin (aya) of pleasures. The destiny (gati, going), the refuge, of
suffering (dukkha) is the unhappy destiny (duggati); or the destiny (gati) produced
by kamma that is corrupted (duttha) by much hate (dosa) is an unhappy destiny
(duggati). Those who commit wrongdoings, being separated out (vivasa) fall
(nipatanti) in here, thus it is perdition (vinipata); or alternatively, when they are
destroyed (vinassanto), they fall (patanti) in here, all their limbs being broken up,
thus it is perdition (vinipata). There is no reason (aya) reckoned as satisfying here,
thus it is hell (niraya).
93.	Or alternatively the animal generation is indicated bv the mention of states
of loss; for the animal generation is a state of loss because it is removed from the

happy destiny; but it is not an unhappy destiny because it allows the existence
of royal nagas (serpents), who are greatly honoured. The realm of ghosts is
indicated by the mention of the unhappy destiny; for that is both a state of loss and
an unhappy destiny because it is removed from the happy destiny and because
it is the destiny of suffering; but it is not perdition because it is not a state of
perdition such as that of the asura demons. The race of asura demons is indicated
by the mention of perdition; for that is both a state of loss and an unhappy
destiny in the way already described, and it is called "perdition" (deprivation)
from all opportunities. Hell itself in the various aspects of Avici, etc., is indicated
by the mention of hell.

Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
Have ... appeared: have gone to; have been reborn there, is the intention.
94.	The bright side should be understood in the opposite way. But there is this
difference. Here the mention of the happy destiny includes the human destiny
and onlv the divine destiny is included by the mention of heavenly. Herein, a
good (sundara) destiny (gati) is a happy destiny (sugati). It is the very highest
(sutthu aggo) in such things as the objective fields comprising visible objects, etc.,
thus it is heavenly (sagga). All that is a world (Ioka) in the sense of crumbling and
disintegrating (lujjana-palujjana). This is the word meaning.
Thus with the divine eye, etc., is all a summing-up phrase; the meaning here in
brief is this: so with the divine eye ... he sees.
95.	Now, a clansman who is a beginner and wants to see in this way should
make sure that the jhana, which has a kasina as its object and is the basis for
direct-knowledge, is made in all ways susceptible of his guidance. Then one of
these three kasinas, that is to say, the fire kasina, white kasina, [428] or light
kasina, should be brought to the neighbourhood [of the arising of divine-eye
knowledge]. He should make this access jhana his resort and stop there to
extend [the kasina]; the intention is that absorption should not be aroused here;
for if he does induce absorption, the [kasina] will become the support for basic
jhana, but not for the [direct-knowledge] preliminary work. The light kasina is
the best of the three. So either that, or one of the others, should be worked up in
the way stated in the Description of the Kasinas, and it should be stopped at the
level of access and extended there. And the method for extending it should be
understood in the way already described there too. It is only what is visible
within the area to which the kasina has been extended that can be seen.
96. However, while he is seeing what is visible, the turn of the preliminary
work runs out. Thereupon the light disappears. When that has disappeared, he
no longer sees what is visible (cf. M III 158). Then he should again and again
attain the basic jhana, emerge and pervade with light. In this way the light
gradually gets consolidated till at length it remains in whatever sized area has
been delimited by him in this way, "Let there be light here." Even if he sits
watching all day he can still see visible objects.
97.	And here there is the simile of the man who set out on a journey by night
with a grass torch. Someone set out on a journey by night, it seems, with a grass
torch. His torch stopped flaming. Then the even and uneven places were no
more evident to him. He stubbed the torch on the ground and it again blazed up.
In doing so it gave more light than before. As it went on dying out and flaring up
again, eventually the sun rose. When the sun had risen, he thought, "There is
no further need of the torch," and he threw it away and went on by daylight.
98.	Herein, the kasina light at the time of the preliminary work is like the light
of the torch. His no more seeing what is visible when the light has disappeared
owing to the turn of the preliminary work running out while he is seeing what
is visible is like the man's not seeing the even and uneven places owing to the
torch's stopping flaming. His repeated attaining is like the stubbing of the
torch. His more powerful pervasion with light by repeating the preliminary
work is like the torch's giving more light than before. The strong light's
`421
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
remaining in as large an area as he delimits is like the sun's rising. His seeing
even during a whole day what is visible in the strong light after throwing the
limited light away is like the man's going on by day after throwing the torch
away.
99.	Herein, when visible objects that are not within the focus of the bhikkhu's
fleshly eye come into the focus of his eye of knowledge—that is to say visible
objects that are inside his bellv, belonging to the heart basis, belonging to what
is below the earth's surface, behind walls, mountains and enclosures, or in
another world-sphere—[429] and are as if seen with the fleshly eye, then it
should be understood that the divine eye has arisen. And onlv that is capable of
seeing the visible objects here, not the preliminary-work consciousnesses.
100.	But this is an obstacle for an ordinary man. Whv? Because wherever he
determines, "Let there be light," it becomes all light, even after penetrating
through earth, sea and mountains. Then fear arises in him when he sees the
fearful forms of spirits, ogres, etc., that are there, owing to which his mind is
distracted and he loses his jhana. So he needs to be careful in seeing what is
visible (see M III 158).
101.	Here is the order of arising of the divine eye: when mind-door adverting,
which has made its object that visible datum of the kind already described, has
arisen and ceased, then, making that same visible datum the object, all should be
understood in the way already described beginning, "Either four or five
impulsions impel ..." (§5) Here also the [three or four] prior consciousnesses
are of the sense sphere and have applied and sustained thought. The last of
these consciousnesses, which accomplishes the aim, is of the fine-material sphere
belonging to the fourth jhana. Knowledge conascent with that is called
"knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings" and "knowledge
of the divine eye."
The explanation of knowledge of passing away and reappearance is ended.
[General]
102.	The Helper, knower of five aggregates,
Had these five direct-knowledges to tell;
When they are known, there are concerning them
These general matters to be known as well.
103.	Among these, the divine eye, called knowledge of passing away and
reappearance, has two accessory kinds of knowledge, that is to say, "knowledge
of the future" and "knowledge of faring according to deeds." So these two along
with the five beginning with the kinds of supernormal power make seven kinds
of direct-knowledge given here.
104.	Now, in order to avoid confusion about the classification of their objects:
The Sage has told four object triads
Bv means of which one can infer
Just how these seven different kinds
Of direct-knowledges occur.
`422
Path of Purification
Part 2: Concentration (Samadhi)
105.	Here is the explanation. Four object triads have been told by the Greatest
of the Sages. What four? The limited-object triad, the path-object triad, the past-
object triad, and the internal-object triad.20
106.	(1) Herein, knowledge of supernormal power [430] occurs with respect to
seven kinds of object, that is to say, as having a limited or exalted, a past, future
or present, and an internal or external object. How?
When he wants to go with an invisible body after making the body dependent
on the mind, and he converts the body to accord with the mind (XII. 119), and he
sets it, mounts it, on the exalted consciousness, then taking it that the [word in
the] accusative case is the proper object,21 it has a limited object because its object
is the material body. When he wants to go with a visible body after making the
mind dependent on the body and he converts the mind to accord with the body
and sets it, mounts it, on the material body, then taking it that the [word in the]
accusative case is the proper object, it has an exalted object because its object is the
exalted consciousness.
107. But that same consciousness takes what has passed, has ceased, as its
object, therefore it has a past object. In those who resolve about the future, as in the
case of the Elder Maha Kassapa in the Great Storing of the Relics, and others, it
has a future object. When the Elder Maha Kassapa was making the great relic
store, it seems, he resolved thus, "During the next two hundred and eighteen
years in the future let not these perfumes dry up or these flowers wither or these
lamps go out," and so it all happened. When the Elder Assagutta saw the
Community of Bhikkhus eating dry food in the Vattaniva Lodging he resolved
thus, "Let the water pool become cream of curd every day before the meal," and
when the water was taken before the meal it was cream of curd; but after the meal
there was only the normal water.22
20. See Abhidhamma Matika ("schedule"), Dhs If. This consists of 22 sets of triple
classifications (tika) and 100 sets of double ones (duka). The first triad "profitable,
unprofitable, and [morally] indeterminate," and the first dyad is "root-cause, not-
root-cause." The Matika is used in the DhammasanganI (for which it serves as the
basic structure), in the Vibhaiiga (in some of the "Abhidhamma Sections" and in the
"Questionnaires") and in the Patthana. All dhammas are either classifiable according
to these triads and dyads, under one of the headings, if the triad or dyad is all-
embracing, or are called "not-so-classifiable" (na-vattabba), if the triad or dyad is not.
The four triads mentioned here are: no. 13, "dhammas with a limited object, with an
exalted object, with a measureless object"; no. 16, "dhammas with a path as object,
with a path as root-cause, with path as predominance"; no. 19, "dhammas with a past
object, with a future object, with a present object"; and no. 21, "dhammas with an
internal object, with an external object, with an internal-external object."
21.	The "word in the accusative case" is in the first instance "body," governed by the
verb "converts" (kayatn parinanieti); see Vism-mht.
22.	Vism-mht comments: "Although with the words: 'These perfumes/ etc., he
apprehends present perfumes, etc., nevertheless the object of his resolving
consciousness is actually their future materiality that is to be associated with the
distinction of not drying up. This is because the resolve concerns the future ... 'Cream
of curd': when resolving, his object is the future appearance of curd."
`423
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
108.	At the time of going with an invisible body after making the body
dependent on the mind it has a present object.
At the time of converting the mind to accord with the body or the body to
accord with the mind, and at the time of creating one's own appearance as a boy,
etc., it has an internal object because it makes one's own body and mind its object.
But at the time of showing elephants, horses, etc., externally it has an external
object.
This is how, firstly the kinds of supernormal power should be understood to
occur with respect to the seven kinds of object.
109.	(2) Knowledge of the divine ear element occurs with respect to four kinds of
object, that is to say as having a limited, and a present, and an internal or
external object. How?
Since it makes sound its object and since sound is limited (see Vibh 74), it
therefore has a limited object.23 But since it occurs only by making existing
sound its object, it has a present object. At the time of hearing sounds in one's own
belly it has an internal object. At the time of hearing the sounds of others it has an
external object. [431] This is how the knowledge of the divine ear element should
be understood to occur with respect to the four kinds of object.
110. (3) Knowledge of penetration of minds occurs with respect to eight kinds of
object, that is to say as having a limited, exalted or measureless object, path as
object, and a past, future or present object, and an external object. How?
At the time of knowing others' sense-sphere consciousness it has a limited
object. At the time of knowing their fine-material-sphere or immaterial-sphere
consciousness it has an exalted object. At the time of knowing path and fruition it
has a measureless object. And here an ordinary man does not know a stream-
enterer's consciousness, nor does a stream-enterer know a once-returner's, and
so up to the Araliant's consciousness. But an Arahant knows the consciousness
of all the others. And each higher one knows the consciousnesses of all those
below him. This is the difference to be understood. At the time when it has path
consciousness as its object it has path as object. But when one knows another's
consciousness within the past seven days, or within the future seven days, then
it has a past object and has a future object respectively.
111.	How does it have a present object? "Present" (paccuppanna) is of three
kinds, that is to say present by moment, present by continuity and present by
extent. Herein, what has reached arising (uppada), presence (thiti), and dissolution
(ibhanga) is present by moment. What is included in one or two rounds of continuity
is present by continuity.
112.	Herein, when someone goes to a well-lit place after sitting in the dark, an
object is not clear at first; until it becomes clear, one or two rounds of continuity
--
Vattanivasenasana was apparently a monastery in the Vindhya Hills (Vinjatavi):
see Mhv XIX.6; Dhs-a 419. The Elders Assagutta and Rohana instructed Kajangala
who was sent to convert Menander (Lamotte, Histoire de la Bouddhisme Indien, p. 440).
23. Cf. also Vibh 62 and 91.
`424
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
should be understood [to pass] meanwhile. And when he goes into an inner
closet after going about in a well-lit place, a visible object is not immediately
evident at first; until it becomes clear, one or two rounds of continuity should be
understood [to pass] meanwhile. When he stands at a distance, although he
sees the alterations (movements) of the hands of waslier-men and the alterations
(movements) of the striking of gongs, drums, etc., yet he does not hear the sound
at first (see Ch. XIV n. 22); until he hears it, one or two rounds of continuity
should be understood [to pass] meanwhile. This, firstly, is according to the
Majjhima reciters.
113. The Samyutta reciters, however, say that there are two kinds of continuity
that is to say, material continuity and immaterial continuity: that a material
continuity lasts as long as the [muddy] line of water touching the bank when
one treads in the water takes to clear,24 as long as the heat of the bodv in one who
has walked a certain extent takes to die down, as long as the blindness in one
who has come from the sunshine into a room does not depart, as long as when,
after someone has been giving attention to his meditation subject in a room and
then opens the shutters by day and looks out, the dazzling in his eyes does not
die down; and that an immaterial continuity consists in two or three rounds of
impulsions. Both of these are [according to them] called "present by continuity"
[432]
114.	What is delimited by a single becoming (existence) is called present by
extent, with reference to which it is said in the Bhaddekaratta Sutta: "Friends, the
mind and mental objects are both what is present. Consciousness is bound by
desire and greed for what is present. Because consciousness is bound by desire
and greed he delights in that. When he delights in that, then he is vanquished
with respect to present states" (M III 197).
And here, "present by continuity" is used in the Commentaries while "present
by extent" is used in the Suttas.
115.	Herein, some25 say that consciousness "present by moment" is the object
of knowledge of penetration of minds. What reason do they give? It is that the
consciousness of the possessor of supernormal power and that of the other arise
in a single moment. Their simile is this: just as when a handful of flowers is
thrown into the air, the stalk of one flower is probably struck by the stalk of
another, and so too, when with the thought, "I will know another's mind," the
mind of a multitude is adverted to as a mass, then the mind of one is probably
penetrated by the mind of the other either at the moment of arising or at the
moment of presence or at the moment of dissolution.
116. That, however, is rejected in the Commentaries as erroneous, because even
if one went on adverting for a hundred or a thousand years, there is never co-
presence of the two consciousnesses, that is to say of that with which he adverts
24.	Vism-mht adds: "Some however explain the meaning in this way: It is as long as,
when one has stepped on the dry bank with a wet foot, the water line on the foot does
not disappear."
25.	The residents of the Abhavagiri Monastery in Anuradhapura (Vism-mht).
`425
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
and that [of impulsion] with which he knows, and because the flaw of plurality
of objects follows if presence [of the same object] to both adverting and impulsion
is not insisted on. What should be understood is that the object is present by
continuity and present bv extent.
117.	Herein, another's consciousness during a time measuring two or three
cognitive series with impulsions extending before and after the [strictly]
currently existing cognitive series with impulsions, is all called "present by
continuity." But in the Samyutta Commentary it is said that "present bv extent"
should be illustrated by a round of impulsions.
118.	That is rightly said. Here is the illustration. The possessor of supemormal-
power who wants to know another's mind adverts. The adverting [consciousness]
makes [the other's consciousness that is] present by moment its object and ceases
together with it. After that there are four or five impulsions, of which the last is
the supernormal-power consciousness, the rest being of the sense sphere. That
same [other's] consciousness, which has ceased, is the object of all these too, and
so they do not have different objects because they have an object that is "present
by extent." And while they have a single object it is only the supernormal-power
consciousness that actually knows another's consciousness, not the others, just
as in the eye-door it is only eye-consciousness that actually sees the visible
datum, not the others.
119.	So this has a present object in what is present by continuity and what is
present by extent. [433] Or since what is present by continuity falls within what
is present by extent, it can therefore be understood that it has a present object
simply in what is present by extent.
It has an external object because it has only another's mind as its object.
This is how knowledge of penetration of minds should be understood to
occur with respect to the eight kinds of objects.
120.	(4) Knowledge of past lives occurs with respect to eight kinds of object, that
is to say as having a limited, exalted, or measureless object, path as object, a past
object, and an internal, external, or not-so-classifiable object. How?
At the time of recollecting sense-snhere aggrrgates it has a limited object. At
the time of recollecting fine-material-sphere or immaterial-sphere aggregates it
has an exalted object. At the time of recollecting a path developed, or a fruition
realized, in the past either by oneself or by others, it has a measureless object. At the
time of recollecting a path developed it has a path as object. But it invariably has a
past object.
121. Herein, although knowledge of penetration of minds and knowledge of
faring according to deeds also have a past object, still, of these two, the object of
the knowledge of penetration of minds is only consciousness within the past
seven days. It knows neither other aggregates nor what is bound up with
aggregates [that is, name, surname, and so on]. It is said indirectly that it has a
path as object since it has the consciousness associated with the path as its
object. Also, the object of knowledge of faring according to deeds is simply past
volition. But there is nothing, whether past aggregates or what is bound up
`426
Path of Purification
Part 2; Concentration (Samadhi)
with aggregates, that is not the object of knowledge of past lives; for that is on a
par with omniscient knowledge with respect to past aggregates and states bound
up with aggregates. This is the difference to be understood here.
122.	This is the method according to the Commentaries here. But it is said in
the Patthana: "Profitable aggregates are a condition, as object condition, for
knowledge of supernormal power, for knowledge of penetration of minds, for
knowledge of past lives, for knowledge of faring according to deeds, and for
knowledge of the future" (Patth I 154), and therefore four aggregates are also the
objects of knowledge of penetration of minds and of knowledge of faring
according to deeds. And there too profitable and unprofitable [aggregates are
the object] of knowledge of faring according to deeds.
123.	At the time of recollecting one's own aggregates it has an internal object. At
the time of recollecting another's aggregates it has an external object. At the time
of recollecting [the concepts consisting in] name, race (surname) in the wav
beginning, "In the past there was the Blessed One Vipassin. His mother was
Bhandumatl. His father was Bhandumant" (see D II 6-7), and [the concept
consisting in] the sign of the earth, etc., it has a not-so-classifiable object. And here
the name and race (surname, lineage) must be regarded not as the actual words
but as the meaning of the words, which is established by convention and bound
up with aggregates. For the actual words [434] are "limited" since they are
included by the sound base, according as it is said: "The discrimination of
language has a limited object" (Vibh 304). Our preference here is this.
This is how the knowledge of past lives should be understood to occur with
respect to the eight kinds of object.
124. (5) Knowledge of the divine exje occurs with respect to four kinds of object,
that is to say as having a limited, a present, and an internal or external object.
How? Since it makes materiality its object and materiality is limited (see Vibh 62)
it therefore has a limited object. Since it occurs onlv with respect to existing
materiality it has a present object. At the time of seeing materiality inside one's
own belly etc., it has an internal object. At the time of seeing another's materiality
it has an external object. This is how the knowledge of the divine eve should be
understood to occur with respect to the four kinds of object.
125.	(6) Knowledge of the future occurs with respect to eight kinds of object, that
is to say, as having a limited or exalted or immeasurable object, a path as object,
a future object, and an internal, external, or not-so classifiable object. How? At
the time of knowing this, "This one will be reborn in the future in the sense
sphere," it has a limited object. At the time of knowing, "He will be reborn in the
fine-material or immaterial sphere," it has an exalted object. At the time of knowing,
"He will develop the path, he will realize fruition," it has an immeasurable object.
At the time of knowing, "He will develop the path," it has a path as object too. But
it invariably has a future object.
126.	Herein, although knowledge of penetration of minds has a future object
too, nevertheless its object is then only future consciousness that is within seven
days; for it knows neither any other aggregate nor what is bound up with
`427
Chapter XIII
Other Direct-knowledges
aggregates. But there is nothing in the future, as described under the knowledge
of past lives (§121), that is not an object of knowledge of the future.
127.	At the time of knowing, "I shall be reborn there," it has an internal object. At
the time of knowing, "So-and-so will be reborn there," it has an external object.
But at the time of knowing name and race (surname) in the way beginning, "In
the future the Blessed One Metteyya will arise. His father will be the brahman
Subrahma. His mother will be the brahmani Brahmavatl" (see D III 76), it has a
not-so-classifiable object in the wav described under knowledge of past lives
(§123).
This is how the knowledge of the future should be understood.
128.	(7) Knowledge of faring according to deeds occurs with respect to five kinds
of object, that is to say, as having a limited or exalted, a past, and an internal or
external object. How? At the time of knowing sense-sphere kamma (deeds) it has
a limited object. [435] At the time of knowing fine-material-sphere or immaterial-
sphere kamma it has an exalted object. Since it knows only what is past it has a past
object. At the time of knowing one's own kamma it has an internal object. At the
time of knowing another's kamma it has an external object. This is how the
knowledge of faring according to deeds should be understood to occur with
respect to the five kinds of object.
129. And when [the knowledge] described here both as "having an internal
object" and "having an external object" knows [these objects] now internally
and now externally it is then said that it has an internal-external object as well.

Direct-knowledge" in the Path of Purification composed

The Aggregates
(Khandha-niddesa)
[A. Understanding]
1. [436] Now, concentration was described under the heading of consciousness
in the stanza:
When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and understanding (1.1).
And that has been developed in all its aspects by the bhikkhu who is thus
possessed of the more advanced development of concentration that has acquired
with direct-knowledge the benefits [described in Chs. XII and XIII]. But
understanding comes next and that has still to be developed. Now, that is not easy
firstly even to know about, let alone to develop, when it is taught verv briefly. In
order, therefore, to deal with the detailed method of its development there is the
following set of questions:
(i)	What is understanding?
(ii)	In what sense is it understanding?
(iii)	What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and
	proximate cause?
(iv)	How many kinds of understanding are there?
(v)	How is it developed?
(vi)	What are the benefits of developing understanding?
2.	Here are the answers:
(i) What is understanding? Understanding (panful) is of many sorts and has various
aspects. An answer that attempted to explain it all would accomplish neither its
intention nor its purpose, and would, besides, lead to distraction; so we shall confine
ourselves to the kind intended here, which is understanding consisting in insight
knowledge associated with profitable consciousness.
3.	(ii) In what sense is it understanding? It is understanding (panful) in the sense
of act of understanding (pajanana).1 What is this act of understanding? It is
1. Cf. Patis I 42, etc.; Abhidhamma definitions very commonly make use of the Pali
forms of verbal nouns, here instanced by panful (understanding = state of under-
standing) and pajdnana (understanding = act of understanding), both from the verb
`432
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
knowing (janana) in a particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving
(saiijdnana) and cognizing (vijdnana). [437] For though the state of knowing
(jdnana-bhdva) is equally present in perception (sanna), in consciousness
(vinndna), and in understanding (panna), nevertheless perception is only the
mere perceiving of an object as, say blue or vellow; it cannot bring about the
penetration of its characteristics as impermanent, painful, and not-self.
Consciousness knows the objects as blue or yellow, and it brings about the
penetration of its characteristics, but it cannot bring about, by endeavouring, the
manifestation of the [supramundane] path. Understanding knows the object in
the way already stated, it brings about the penetration of the characteristics, and
it brings about, by endeavouring, the manifestation of the path.
4. Suppose there were three people, a child without discretion, a villager, and a
money-changer, who saw a heap of coins lying on a money-changer's counter. The
child without discretion knows merely that the coins are figured and ornamented,
long, square or round; he does not know that they are reckoned as valuable for
human use and enjoyment. And the villager knows that they are figured and
ornamented, etc., and that they are reckoned as valuable for human use and
enjoyment; but he does not know such distinctions as, "This one is genuine, this is
false, this is half-value." The money-changer knows all those kinds, and he does so
by looking at the coin, and bv listening to the sound of it when struck, and by
smelling its smell, tasting its taste, and weighing it in his hand, and he knows that
it was made in a certain village or town or city or on a certain mountain or by a
certain master. And this may be understood as an illustration.
5. Perception is like the child without discretion seeing the coin, because it
apprehends the mere mode of appearance of the object as blue and so on.
Consciousness is like the villager seeing the coin, because it apprehends the
mode of the object as blue, etc., and because it extends further, reaching the
penetration of its characteristics. Understanding is like the money-changer
seeing the coin, because, after apprehending the mode of the object as blue, etc.,
and extending to the penetration of the characteristics, it extends still further,
reaching the manifestation of the path.
That is whv this act of understanding should be understood as "knowing in a
particular mode separate from the modes of perceiving and cognizing." For that is
what the words "it is understanding in the sense of act of understanding" refer to.
6. However, it is not always to be found where perception and consciousness are.2
[438] But when it is, it is not disconnected from those states. And because it cannot
be taken as disconnected thus: "This is perception, this is consciousness, this is
understanding," its difference is consequently subtle and hard to see. Hence the
venerable Nagasena said: "A difficult thing, O King, has been done by the Blessed
One."—"What, venerable Nagasena, is the difficult thing that has been done by the
Blessed One?"—"The difficult thing, O King, done by the Blessed One was the

pajmulti (he understands). English does not always, as in this case, distinguish between
the two. Similarly for example, from the verb socati (he sorrows) we find soka (sorrow,
state of sorrowing) and socana (sorrowing, act of sorrowing), and here the English
differentiates. Cf. parallel treatment of panna at M-a II 343f.

defining of the immaterial states of consciousness and its concomitants, which
occur with a single object, and which he declared thus: 'This is contact, this is
feeling, this is perception, this is volition, this is consciousness'" (Mil 87).
7.	(iii) What are its characteristic, function, manifestation and proximate cause?
Understanding has the characteristic of penetrating the individual essences of
states.3 Its function is to abolish the darkness of delusion, which conceals the
individual essences of states. It is manifested as non-delusion. Because of the
words, "One who is concentrated knows and sees correctly" (A V 3), its proximate
cause is concentration.
8.	(iv) How MANY KINDS OF UNDERSTANDING ARE THERE?
1.	Firstly as having the characteristic of penetrating the individual
essences of states, it is of one kind.
2.	As mundane and supramundane it is of two kinds.
3.	Likewise as subject to cankers and free from cankers, and so on,
4.	As the defining of mentality and of materiality,
5.	As accompanied by joy or by equanimity,
6.	As the planes of seeing and of development.
7.	It is of three kinds as consisting in what is reasoned, consisting
in what is learnt (heard), and consisting in development.
8.	Likewise as having a limited, exalted, or measureless object,
9.	As skill in improvement, detriment, and means,
10.	As interpreting the internal, and so on.
11.	It is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truths,
12.	And as the four discriminations.4
9. 1. Herein, the singlefold section is obvious in meaning.
2. As regards the twofold section, the mundane is that associated with the
mundane path and the supramundane is that associated with the supramundane
path. So it is of two kinds as mundane and supramundane.
--
2.	"Ill arisings of consciousness with two root-causes [i.e. with non-greed and non-
hate but without non-delusion], or without root-cause, understanding does not occur"
(Vism-mht 432). "Just as pleasure is not invariably inseparable from happiness, so
perception and consciousness are not invariably inseparable from understanding.
But just as happiness is invariably inseparable from pleasure, so understanding is
invariably inseparable from perception and consciousness" (Vism-mht 432).
3.	"A phenomenon's own essence (sako bhavo) or existing essence (samano va bhava)
is its individual essence (sabhava)" (Vism-mht 433). Cf. Ch. VIII, note 68, where Vism-
mht gives the definition from saha-bhava (with essence).
4.	Patisambhida is usually rendered by "analysis" (see e.g. Points of Controversy—
Katliavattlm translation—pp. 377ff). But the Tipitaka explanations of the four patisambhida
suggest no emphasis on analysis rather than synthesis. Vism-mht gives the following
definition of the term: "Knowledge that is classified (pabheda-gata = put into a division)
under meaning (attha) as capable of effecting the explanation and definition of specific

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
10.	3. In the second dyad, that subject to cankers is that which is the object of
cankers. That free from cankers is not their object. This dyad is the same in meaning
as the mundane and supramundane. The same method applies to the dyads
subject to cankers and free from cankers, associated with cankers and dissociated
from cankers (Dhs 3), and so on. So it is of two kinds as subject to cankers and
free from cankers, and so on.
11.	4. In the third dyad, when a man wants to begin insight, his understanding
of the defining of the four immaterial aggregates is understanding as defining of
mentality, [439] and his understanding of the defining of the material aggregate
is understanding as defining of materiality. So it is of two kinds as the defining of
mentality and of materiality
12.	5. In the fourth dyad, understanding belonging to two of the kinds of
sense-sphere profitable consciousness, and belonging to sixteen5 of the kinds of
path consciousness with four of the jhanas in the fivefold method, is accompanied
by joy. Understanding belonging to two of the kinds of sense-sphere profitable
consciousness, and belonging to (the remaining) four kinds of path
consciousness with the fifth jhanas is accompanied by equanimity. So it is of two
kinds as accompanied by joy or by equanimity
13.	6. In the fifth dyad, understanding belonging to the first path is the plane of
seeing. Understanding belonging to the remaining three paths is the plane of
development (see XXII. 127). So it is of two kinds as the planes of seeing and of
development.
14.	7. As regards the triads, understanding acquired without hearing from
another is that consisting in what is reasoned because it is produced by one's own
reasoning. Understanding acquired by hearing from another is that consisting
in what is heard, because it is produced by hearing. Understanding that has
reached absorption, having been somehow produced by (meditative)
development, is that consisting in development. And this is said: Herein, what
is understanding consisting in what is reasoned? In the spheres of work invented
by ingenuity or in the spheres of craft invented by ingenuity or in the sorts of
science invented by ingenuity, any preference, view, choice, opinion, judgment,
liking for pondering over things, that concerns ownership of deeds (kamma) or is
in conformity with truth or is of such kind as to conform with (the axioms)
'Materiality is impermanent' or 'Feeling ... perception ... formations ...

characteristics of the meaning class (meaning division) is called attha-patisambhida;
and so with the other three" (Vism-mht 436). "Discrimination" has been chosen for
patisambhida because, while it has the sense of "division," it does not imply an opposite
process as "analysis" does. Also it may be questioned whether the four are well
described as "entirely logical": "entirely epistemological" might perhaps be both less
rigid and nearer; for they seem to cover four interlocking fields, namely: meanings of
statements and effects of causes (etc.), statements of meanings and causes of effects
(etc.), language as restricted to etymological rules of verbal expression, and clarity (or
perspicuous inspiration) in marshalling the other three.

out of the five (Vism-mh 434).

The Aggregates
consciousness is impermanent' that one acquires without hearing it from
another—that is called understanding consisting in what is reasoned.
(In the spheres ) that one acquires by hearing it from another—that is called
understanding consisting in what is learnt (heard).
And all understanding in anyone who has attained (an attainment) is
understanding consisting in development (Vibh 324-25).
So it is of three kinds as consisting in what is thought out, in what is heard,
and in development.
15. 8. In the second triad, the understanding that occurs contingent upon
sense-sphere states has a limited object. That which occurs contingent upon
fine-material-sphere states or immaterial-sphere states has an exalted object. That
is mundane insight. That which occurs contingent upon Nibbana has a
measureless object. That is supramundane insight. So it is of three kinds as having
a limited, an exalted, or a measureless object.
16.	9. In the third triad, it is increase that is called improvement. That is twofold
as the elimination of harm and the arousing of good. Skill in improvement is
skill in these, according as it is said: Herein, what is skill in improvement? When
a man brings these things to mind both unarisen unprofitable things do not
arise and arisen unprofitable things are abandoned in him; or when he brings
these things to mind [440] both unarisen profitable things arise and arisen
profitable things advance to growth, increase, development, and perfection in
him. Whatever here is understanding, act of understanding [for words elided
see Dhs 16] non-delusion, investigation of states, right view, is called skill in
improvement (Vibh 325-26).
17.	Non-increase is what is called detriment. That also is twofold as the
diminution of good and the arousing of harm. Skill in detriment is skill in these,
according as it is said: "Herein, what is skill in detriment? When a man brings
these things to mind, both unarisen profitable things do not arise ..." (Vibh
326), and so on.
18.	But in either of these cases any skill in means to cause the production of
such and such things, which skill occurs at that moment and is aroused on that
occasion, is what is called skill in means, according as it is said: "And all
understanding of means thereto is skill in means'' (Vibh 326).
So it is of three kinds as skill in improvement, in detriment, and in means.
19. 10. In the fourth triad, insight-understanding initiated by apprehending
one's own aggregates is interpreting the internal.6 That initiated by apprehending
another's aggregates or external materiality not bound up with the faculties,
[that is, inanimate matter], is interpreting the external. That initiated by
apprehending both is interpreting the internal and external. So it is of three kinds
as interpreting the internal, and so on.

6. The word abhinivisati with its noun abhinivesa means literally "to dwell on," and so
"to adhere," or "insist." In the Tipitaka it always appears in a bad sense and always

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
20.	11. As regards the tetrads, in the first tetrad, knowledge that occurs
contingent upon the truth of suffering is knowledge of suffering; knowledge that
occurs contingent upon the origin of suffering is knowledge of the origin of
suffering; knowledge that occurs contingent upon the cessation of suffering is
knowledge of the cessation of suffering; and knowledge that occurs contingent upon
the way leading to the cessation of suffering is knowledge of the way leading to the
cessation of suffering. So it is of four kinds as knowledge of the four truths.
21.	12. In the second tetrad, the four kinds of knowledge classed as that
concerned with meaning, etc., are called the four discriminations. For this is said:
"Knowledge about meaning is the discrimination of meaning (attha-
patisambhida). Knowledge about law is the discrimination of law (dhamma-
patisambhida). Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with meaning
and law is the discrimination of language (nirutti-patisambhida). Knowledge
about kinds of knowledge is discrimination of perspicuity (patibhana-
patisambhida)" (Vibh 293).
22.	Herein, meaning (attha) is briefly a term for the fruit of a cause (lietu). For in
accordance with the cause it is served7 arrived at, reached, therefore it is called
"meaning" (or "purpose"). But in particular the five things, namely (i) anything
conditionally produced, [441] (ii) Nibbana, (iii) the meaning of what is spoken,
(iv) (kamma-) result, and (v) functional (consciousness), should be understood
as meaning. When anyone reviews that meaning, any knowledge of his, falling
within the category (pabheda) concerned with meaning, is the discrimination of
meaning.
23.	Law (dhamma) is briefly a term for a condition (paccaya). For since a condition
necessitates (dahati) whatever it may be, makes it occur or allows it to happen, it
is therefore called "law" (dhamma). But in particular the five things, namely (i)
any cause that produces fruit, (ii) the noble path, (iii) what is spoken, (iv) what is
profitable, and (v) what is unprofitable, should be understood as law. When
anyone reviews that law, any knowledge of his, falling within the category
concerned with law, is the discrimination of law.

appears in contexts with wrong view and clinging (see e.g. M III 30-31, Nidd I 436,
and also Vism-mht quoted above at I. 140). However, in the Commentaries, the word
appears also in a good sense as at XIV130, XXI.73 and 83f., and at M-a I 250 (cf.
saddharn nivisati, MII173). hi this good sense it is synonymous with right interpretation
of experience. All the bare experience of perception is interpreted by the mind either
in the sense of permanence, pleasure, self, which is wrong because it is not confirmed
by experience, or in the sense of impermanence, etc., which is right because it is
confirmed by experience (see XIV 130). There is no not interpreting experience, and it
is a function of the mind that the interpretation adopted is "dwelt upon," i.e. insisted
upon. And so it is this insistence or interpretation in accordance with reality as
confirmed by experience that is the abhinivesa of the Commentaries in the good sense.
For these reasons the words interpretation, misinterpretation and insistence have been
chosen here as renderings.
7. ArJyati—"to honour, to serve." Not in PED. Cf. ger. aranlya (M-a I 21,173), also not
in PED, explained by the Majjhima Nidaya tika as "to be honoured" (payirupasitabba).

The Aggregates
24. This same meaning is shown in the Abhidhamma bv the following analysis:
(a)	"Knowledge about suffering is the discrimination of meaning. Knowledge
about the origin of suffering is the discrimination of law. [Knowledge about
the cessation of suffering is the discrimination of meaning. Knowledge about
the way leading to the cessation of suffering is the discrimination of law] ...
(b)	"Knowledge about cause is the discrimination of law. Knowledge about the
fruit of a cause is the discrimination of meaning ...
(c)	"Knowledge about whatever things are born, become,] brought to birth,
produced, completed, made manifest, is the discrimination of meaning.
Knowledge about the things from which those things were born, became,
were brought to birth, produced, completed, made manifest, is the
discrimination of law ...
(d)	"Knowledge about ageing and death is the discrimination of meaning.
Knowledge about the origin of ageing and death is the discrimination of law.
[Knowledge about the cessation of ageing and death is the discrimination of
meaning. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation of ageing and
death is the discrimination of law. Knowledge about birth ... becoming ...
clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact ... the sixfold base ... mentality-
materiality ... consciousness ... knowledge about formations is the
discrimination of meaning. Knowledge about the origin of formations is the
discrimination of law.] Knowledge about the cessation of formations is the
discrimination of meaning. Knowledge about the way leading to the cessation
of formations is the discrimination of law ...
(e)	"Here a bhikkhu knows the Dhamma (Law)—the Discourses, Songs,
[Expositions, Stanzas, Exclamations, Savings, Birth Stories, Marvels, and]
Answers to Questions—this is called the discrimination of law. He knows the
meaning of whatever is said thus: 'This is the meaning of this that was said;
this is the meaning of this that was said'—this is called the discrimination of
meaning ...
(f)	"What states are profitable? On an occasion when profitable
consciousness of the sense sphere has arisen [that is accompanied by joy
and associated with knowledge, having a visible datum as its object ... or a
mental datum as its object, or contingent upon whatever it may be, on that
occasion there is contact... (for elision see Dhs §1) ... there is non-wavering]—
these things are profitable. Knowledge about these things is the discrimination
of law. Knowledge about their result is the discrimination of meaning" ...
(Vibh 293-95).8
25. Knowledge about enunciation of language dealing with meaning and law (§21):
there is the language that is individual essence, the usage that has no exceptions,9
and deals with that meaning and that law. Any knowledge falling within the
category concerned with the enunciation of that, with the speaking, with the
utterance of that, concerned with the root-speech of all beings, the Magadhan

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
language that is individual essence, in other words, the language of law
(dhamma), [any knowledge that] as soon as it hears it spoken, pronounced, uttered,
knows, "This is the individual-essence language; this is not the individual-
essence language"—[such knowledge] is discrimination of language.10 [442] One
who has reached the discrimination of language knows, on hearing the words
"phasso, vedana," etc., that that is the individual-essence language, and on hearing
"phassa, vedano," etc., he knows that that is not the individual-essence language.
26.	Knowledge about kinds of knowledge (§21): when a man is reviewing and makes
any of the foregoing kinds of knowledge the object [of his knowledge], then any
knowledge in him that has knowledge as its object is discrimination of perspicuity,
and so is any knowledge about these aforesaid kinds of knowledge, which is
concerned with details of their individual domains, functions, and so on.
27.	And these four kinds of discrimination can be placed in two categories: the
plane of the trainer and the plane of the non-trainer. Herein, those of the chief
disciples and great disciples come into the category of the non-trainer's plane.
Those of the Elder Ananda, the householder Citta, the layman Dhammika, the
householder Upali, the laywoman Khujjuttara, etc., come into the category of the
trainer's plane.
28.	And though they come into the categories of the two planes thus, they are
nevertheless distinguishable in five aspects, that is to say, as achievement, mastery
of scriptures, hearing, questioning, and prior effort. Herein, achievement is the
reaching of Arahantship. Mastery of scriptures is mastery of the Buddha's word.
Hearing is learning the Dhamma carefully and attentively. Questioning is
discussion of knotty passages and explanatory passages in the texts,
commentaries, and so on. Prior effort is devotion to insight in the dispensation of
former Buddhas, up to the vicinity of [the stages of] conformity and change-of-
lineage by one who has practiced [the duty of] going [with the meditation subject
on alms round] and coming back [with it].11
29.	Others have said:
A prior effort, and great knowledge,
[Knowledge of] dialects, of scriptures,
And questioning, and then achievement,
And likewise waiting on a teacher,
Success in friends—these are conditions
Productive of discriminations.
9.	Byabhicara (vyabhicara): not in PED; normal grammarian's term for an "exception."
10.	The idea behind the term "individual-essence language" (sabhavanirutti), that is
to say, that there is a real name for each thing that is part of that thing's individual
essence, is dealt with at Dhs-a 391-92. Magadhan as "the root speech of all beings"
and the "individual-essence language" is dealt with in greater detail at Vibh-a 387.
11.	The expression garapaccagatikabhava refers to the practice of "carrying the
meditation subject to and from the alms round," which is described at M-a I 257 in
detail. The same expression is also used of a certain kind of refuse-rag (see II. 17).
`439
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
30.	Herein, prior effort is the same as that already stated. Great learning is skill
in some science or sphere of craft. Dialects means skill in the hundred-and-one
tongues, particularly in that of Magadha. Scriptures means mastery of the
Buddha's word, even if only of the Chapter of Similes.12 Questioning is questioning
about defining the meaning of even a single stanza. Achievement is stream-entry
... or Arahantship. Waiting on a teacher is living with very learned intelligent
teachers. Success in friends is acquisition of friends such as that. [443]
31.	Herein, Buddhas and Paccekabuddhas reach the discriminations through
prior effort and through achievement. Disciples do so through all these means.
And there is no special way of developing a meditation subject in order to attain
discriminations. But in trainers the attaining of the discriminations comes about
next upon the liberation consisting in trainers' fruition, and in non-trainers it
does so next upon the liberation consisting in non-trainers' fruition. For the
discriminations come to success in Noble Ones only through the noble fruition
as the ten powers do in Perfect Ones.
So these were the discriminations referred to when it was said above: "It is of
four kinds ... as the four discriminations" (§8).
32.	(v) How is it developed? Now, tHE things CLASsed as aggregates, bases,
elements, faculties, truths, dependent origination, etc., are the soil of this
understanding, and the [first] two purifications, namely, purification of virtue
and purification of consciousness, are its roots, while the five purifications,
namely purification of view, purification by overcoming doubt, purification by
knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path, purification
by knowledge and vision of the way and purification by knowledge and vision,
are the trunk. Consequently one who is perfecting these should first fortify his
knowledge by learning and questioning about those things that are the "soil"
after he has perfected the two purifications that are the "roots," then he can
develop the five purifications that are the "trunk." This is in brief. The detail is as
follows.
[B. Description of the Five Aggregates]
33.	When it was said above "the things classed as aggregates, bases, elements,
faculties, truths, dependent origination, etc., are the soil," the aggregates here
are the five aggregates, that is to say, the materiality aggregate, the feeling
aggregate, the perception aggregate, the formations aggregate, and the

[The Materiality Aggregate]
34. Herein, all kinds of states whatsoever that have the characteristic of "being
molested" (rupparta) by cold, etc., taken all together should be understood as the
materiality (rupa) aggregate.

1.	That is of one kind with the characteristic of "being molested."
2.	It is also of two kinds when classed as (a) primary entity (bhuta) and (b)
derived [by clinging] (upadaya).
35.	Herein (a) primary materiality is of four kinds as the earth element, water
element, fire element, and air element. Their characteristic, function, and
manifestation have been given under the definition of the four elements (XI.87,
93); but as to the proximate cause, each has the other three as its proximate
cause. [444]
36.	(b) Derived materiality is of twenty-four kinds as eye, ear, nose, tongue, body
visible datum, sound, odour, flavour;13 femininity faculty, masculinity faculty, life
faculty heart-basis; bodily intimation, verbal intimation; space element; lightness of
matter, malleability of matter, wieldiness of matter, growth of matter, continuity of
matter, ageing of matter, impermanence of matter, and physical nutriment.
37.	1. Herein, the eye's characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is
ready for the impact of visible data; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary
elements originated bv kamma sourcing from desire to see.14 Its function is to

13.	"Tangible data are omitted from this list because, not being derived matter, they
are included in the primaries" (Vism-mht 442). They are described as consisting of
three of the four primaries, excluding the water (cohesion) element. "What is the
materiality of the great primaries? It is the tangible-data base and the water-element"
(Dhs 663). For the whole list see Dhs 596, in which (N.B.) the heart-basis does not
appear. See also note 32 and Ch. XV n. 15.
14.	"Here the first-mentioned characteristic of the eye is described according to the
kamma that produces a selfhood, and is common to all of it, and this without touching
on differentiation is the cause. The second is according to the specialized kamma
generated thus, "Let my eve be thus." This is what they say But it can be taken that the
first-mentioned characteristic is stated as sensitivity's interest in lighting up its own
objective fields, the five senses' state of sensitivity being taken as a generality; and
that the second is stated as the seeing that is due to the particular division of its own
cause, the sensitivities' cause as the state of kamma being taken as a generality or as
a unity. The same method applies to the ear and so on.
"Here it may be asked, 'Is the arising of the faculties of the eye, etc., due to kamma
that is one or to kamma that is different?' Now, the Ancients say, "In both ways."
Herein, firstly, in the case of the arising of an eye, etc., due to kamma that is different
there is nothing to be explained since the cause is divided up. But when their arising
is due to kamma that is one, how does there come to be differentiation among them?
It is due to dividedness in the cause too. For it is craving, in the form of longing for this
or that kind of becoming that, itself having specific forms owing to hankering after the
sense-bases included in some kind of becoming or other, contrives, acting as decisive-
support, the specific divisions in the kamma that generates such a kind of becoming.
As soon as the kamma has acquired the differentiation induced by that [hankering] it
generates through effort consisting in appropriate ability a multiple fruit with
differentiated individual essences, as though it had itself taken on a multiple form.
And the ability here need not be understood as anything other than the able state; for
it is simply the effort of producing fruit that is differentiated by the differentiation due
to the differentiation in its cause. And the fact of this differentiating effort on the part

pick up [an object]15 among visible data. It is manifested as the footing of eye-
consciousness. Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing
from desire to see.
38.	2. The ear's characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready for the
impact of sounds; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements originated
by kamma sourcing from desire to hear. Its function is to pick up [an object] among
sounds. It is manifested as the footing of ear-consciousness. Its proximate cause is
primary elements bom of kamma sourcing from desire to hear.
39.	3. The nose's characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready
for the impact of odours; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements
originated by kamma sourcing from desire to smell. Its function is to pick up [an
object] among odours. It is manifested as the footing of nose-consciousness. Its
proximate cause is primary elements bom of kamma sourcing from desire to smell.
40.	4. The tongue's characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready
for the impact of flavours; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements
originated by kamma sourcing from desire to taste. Its function is to pick up [an
object] among flavours. It is manifested as the footing of tongue-consciousness. Its
proximate cause is primary elements bom of kamma sourcing from desire to taste.
41.	5. The body's characteristic is sensitivity of primary elements that is ready
for the impact of tangible data; or its characteristic is sensitivity of primary
elements originated by kamma sourcing from desire to touch. Its function is to
pick up [an object] among tangible data. It is manifested as the footing of body-
consciousness. Its proximate cause is primary elements born of kamma sourcing
from desire to touch.
42.	Some,16 however, say that the eye is sensitivity of primary elements that have
fire in excess, and that the ear, nose, and tongue are sensitivity of primary elements
that have [respectively] air, earth, and water in excess, and that the body is that of
all [four equally]. Others say that the eye is sensitivity of those that have fire in
excess, and that the ear, nose, tongue, and body are [sensitivity] of those that
have [respectively] aperture, air, water, and earth in excess. They should be asked
to quote a sutta. They will certainly not find one.
43. But some give as their reason that it is because these [several sensitivities]
are [respectively] aided by visible data, etc., as qualities of fire, and so on.17 They
--
of kamma that is one being the cause of the multiple faculties will be dealt with below
as to logic and texts (note 21). Besides, it is told how one kind of consciousness only
is the cause of the generation of the sixteen kinds of resultant consciousness and so
on; and in the world it is also found that a single paddy seed is the cause of the
generation of the ripe, the unripe, the husked, and the unliusked fruit. But what is the
use of logical thinking? For the eye, etc., are the fruit of kamma; and kamma-result is
exclusively the province of a Buddha's knowledge" (Vism-mht 444).
15.	Avinjana—"picking up": see avijjhati in PED.
16.	"'Some' are certain Mahasanghikas; for among these Vasudhamma says this: 'In
the eye fire is in excess; in the ear, air; in the nose, earth; in the tongue, water; in the
bodv all are equal'" (Vism-mht 444).

should be asked, "But who has said that visible data, etc., are qualities of fire and so
on? [445] For it is not possible to say of primary elements, which remain always
inseparable,18 that This is a quality of this one, that is a quality of that one.'"
44.	Then they may say: "Just as you assume, from excess of some primary
element in such and such material things, the [respective] functions of upholding
(sandharana), etc., for earth, etc., so from finding visibility, etc., [respectively] in a
state of excess19 in material things that have fire in excess, one may assume that
visible data, etc., are [respectively] qualities of these." Thev should be told: "We
might assume it if there were more odour in cotton, which has earth in excess,
than in fermented liquor, which has water in excess, and if the colour of cold
water were weaker than the colour of hot water, which has heat in excess.
45.	"But since neither of these is a fact, you should therefore give up conjecturing
the difference to be in the supporting primary elements. Just as the natures of visible
objects, etc., are dissimilar from each other though there is no difference in the
primaries that form a single group, so too are eye-sensitivity etc., though no other
cause of their difference exists."20 This is how it should be taken.
--
17. "'As qualities of fire, and so on : [aided] by visible data as the illuminating [quality] of
heat, which is called lighting up; by sound [as a quality] of air, by odour [as a quality] of
earth, by flavour [as a quality] of the water called spittle—so according to the first theory
[that of 'some']; and it can be suitably adjusted to accord with the second [that of 'others']
because thev need to be assisted by such and such qualities of primaries what is meant is
that thev have to be helped in apprehending visible data and so on. This theory holds that
the quality is the ability of the eye, etc., to light up [respectively] visible data, etc., onlv when
associated with the reasons that are their accessories consisting of light, etc., and aperture's
state of decisive support for ear-consciousness. Aperture is taken in due order, as are tire,
etc., since it is absence of primaries. Or alternatively when others intend that aperture is a
quality of primaries, as visible data, etc., are, then the qualities of primaries are cons tillable
in their order thus: [aided] by visible data and light [as a quality] of fire, by sound [as a
quality] of aperture called space, by odour [as a quality] of air, by flavour [as a quality] of
water, bv tangible data [as a quality! of earth" (Vism-mht 445).
18.	The four primaries are held to be inseparable and not to exist separate from each
other; cf. quotation from the "Ancients" in §45. Vism-mht says: "Excess is in capability
not in quantity otherwise their inseparability would be illogical" (Vism-mht 451).
19.	"'From finding visibility, etc., [respectively] in a state of excess': from finding them
associated with these differences, namely, the bright visible datum in fire, sound
audible through its individual essence in air, the odour beginning with surabhi perfume
in earth, and the sweet taste in water, thus 'visible data, etc., are the [respective] qualities
of these.' This is according to the first theory, and he has stated the conclusion (uttara)
that follows, beginning with 'we might assume' in terms of that. The second is confuted
in the same way. Or alternatively, 'Then they may say,' etc., can be taken as said
emphasizing, in order to confute it, the theory of Kanada, which asserts that the eye,
etc., are respectively made by fire, space, earth, water, and air, that have visible data,
etc., as their respective qualities" (Vism-mht 445).

single group," occurs in this sentence but is not in the Harvard text.

The Aggregates
But what is it that is not common to them all?21 It is the kamma itself that is the
reason for their difference. Therefore their difference is due to difference of kamma,
not to difference of primary elements; for if there were difference of primary
elements, sensitivity itself would not arise, since the Ancients have said:
"Sensitivity is of those that are equal, not of those that are unequal."
46. Now, among these [sensitivities thus] possessed of difference due to differ-
ence of kamma, the eye and the ear apprehend non-contiguous objective fields,
since consciousness is caused even if the supporting [primaries] of the objective
fields do not adhere to the [faculties'] own supporting primaries.22 The nose,
--
21. "If there is no differentiation according to primaries, what then is the reason for
the differentiation of the eye, and so on? Though the kamma that is produced by the
longing for a selfhood (individual personality) with five sense-bases is one only, still
it should be taken as called'not common to them all' and 'difference of kamma' because it is
the cause of the differentiation of the eye, and so on. For it is not a condition for the ear
through the same particular difference through which it is a condition for the eye,
since, if it were, it would then follow that there was no distinction between the faculties.
Because of the words, 'At the moment of rebirth-linking, exalted volition is a condition,
as kamma condition, for the kinds of materiality due to kamma performed' (Patth) it
must be recognized that a single volition is kamma condition for all the kinds of
materiality due to kamma performed that come into existence at the moment of
rebirth-linking. For if the volition were different, then, when there came to be the
arising of the faculties, it would follow that the materiality due to kamma performed
was generated by limited and exalted kamma. And rebirth-linking that is one is not
generated by a plurality of kinds of kamma. Thus it is established that the arising of
the plurality of the faculties is due to a single kamma" (Vism-mht 446).
22. See also §134 and notes 60, 61. The amplification in this paragraph is from Vism-
mht, which continues: "There is another method: the eye and the ear have
non-contiguous objective fields because arising of consciousness is caused while
their objective fields are separated by an interval and apart (adltika). Some sav that the
ear has a contiguous objective field. If it did, then sound born of consciousness would
not be the object of ear-consciousness, for there is no arising externally of what is
consciousness-originated. And in the texts sound as object is spoken of as being the
object of ear-consciousness without making any distinction. Besides, there would be
no defining the direction and position of the sound because it would then have to be
apprehended in the place occupied by the possessor of the objective field, as happens
in the case of an odour. Consequently it remains in the same place where it arose, if it
comes into focus in the ear avenue (so the Burmese ed.). Are not the sounds of
washermen [beating their washing on stones] heard later by those who stand at a
distance? No; because there is a difference in the way of apprehending a sound
according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one nearby and to one at a
distance. For just as, because of difference in the way of apprehending the sound of
words according to the ways in which it becomes evident to one at a distance and to
one nearby there comes to be [respectively] not apprehending, and apprehending of
the differences in the syllables, so also, when the sound of washermen (a) becomes
[an occurrence] that is evident throughout from beginning to end to one who is
nearby, and (b) becomes an occurrence that is evident in compressed form in the end
or in the middle to one who is at a distance, it is because there is a difference in the
`444

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
tongue and body apprehend contiguous objective fields, because consciousness
is caused only if their objective fields' [primaries] adhere to their own supporting
[primaries], [that is to say, if the objective fields' primaries adhere] as support [in
the case of odours and flavours], and themselves [directly in the case of tangible
data, which are identical with the three primaries excluding water].
47. 1. There is what is called the "eye" in the world. That looks like a blue lotus
petal and is surrounded by black eyelashes and varied with dark and light
circles. The eve [sensitivity as meant] here is to be found in the place in the
middle of the black circle surrounded by the white circle in that [feature of the]
eye with its accessories where there appears the image of the bodies of those
who stand in front of it. It pervades the eye's seven layers like oil sprinkled on
seven layers of cotton. It is assisted by the four primary elements whose
[respective] functions are upholding, cohering, maturing, and moving, as a
warrior prince is by four nurses whose functions are holding, bathing, dressing,
and fanning. It is consolidated by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment; it
is maintained by life; it is furnished with colour, odour, flavour, etc. (see Ch.
XVIII, §5); it is the size of a mere louse's head; and it duly serves both as physical
basis and as door for eye-consciousness, and the rest [of the consciousness of
the cognitive series]. [446]
48.	And this is said by the General of the Dhamma:
"The sensitivity with which he sees a visible object
Is small and it is subtle, too, no bigger, than a louse's head."(?)
49.	2. The ear [sensitivity] is to be found inside the [feature of the] ear-hole with
its accessories in the place that is shaped like a finger-stall and surrounded by
fine brown hairs. It is assisted by the elements in the way aforesaid. It is
consolidated by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment; it is maintained by
life; it is equipped with colour, etc.; and it duly serves both as physical basis and
as door for ear-consciousness, and the rest.
50.	3. The nose [sensitivity] is to be found inside the [feature of the] nose-hole
with its accessories in the place shaped like a goat's hoof. It has assistance,
consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid; and it duly serves both as
physical basis and as door for nose-consciousness, and the rest.
51. 4. The tongue [sensitivity] is to be foimd in the middle of the [feature of the]
tongue with its accessories in the place shaped like a lotus petal tip. It has assistance,
consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid; and it duly serves both as
physical basis and as door for tongue-consciousness, and the rest.
apprehending and definition, which occur later in the cognitive series of ear-
consciousness, that there comes to be the assumption (abhimana) 'Heard faintly is
heard later.' But that sound comes into the ear's focus at the moment of its own
existence and in dependence on the place where it arises (see XIII. 112; Dhs-a 313). If
there is absolutely no successive becoming of sound, how does an echo arise? The
sound, though it remains at a distance, is a condition for the arising of an echo and for
the vibration of vessels, etc., elsewhere as a magnet (ayo-kanta) is for the movement of
iron" (Vism-mht 446-47).

The Aggregates
52.	5. The body [sensitivity] is to be found everywhere, like a liquid that soaks a
layer of cotton, in this physical body where there is matter that is clung to.23 It has
assistance, consolidation and maintenance in the way aforesaid too; and it duly
serves both as physical basis and as door for body-consciousness, and the rest.
53.	Like snakes, crocodiles, birds, dogs, and jackals that gravitate to their own
respective resorts, that is to say, termite-mounds, water, space, villages, and charnel
grounds, so the eye, etc., should be regarded as gravitating to their own respective
resorts, that is to say visible data, and so on (cf. Dhs-a 314).
54.	6. As regards visible data, etc., which come next, a visible datum has the
characteristic of impinging on the eye. Its function is to be the objective field of
eye-consciousness. It is manifested as the resort of that too. Its proximate cause is
the four great primaries. And all the [following] kinds of derived materiality are
the same as this. Where there is a difference we shall mention it. This [visible
datum] is of various kinds as "blue, yellow" (Dhs §617) and so on.
55.	7. Sound has the characteristic of impinging on the ear. Its function is to be
the object of ear-consciousness. It is manifested as the resort of that too. It is of
various kinds as "drum sound, tabour sound" (Dhs §621) and so on. [447]
56.	8. Odour has the characteristic of impinging on the nose. Its function is to
be the object of nose-consciousness. It is manifested as the resort of that too. It is
of various kinds as "root odour, heartwood odour" (Dhs §625) and so on.
57.	9. Flavour has the characteristic of impinging on the tongue. Its function is
to be the object of tongue-consciousness. It is manifested as the resort of that too.
It is of various kinds as "root flavour, trunk flavour" (Dhs §629) and so on.
58.	10. The femininity faculty has the female sex as its characteristic. Its function
is to show that "this is a female." It is manifested as the reason for the mark,
sign, work, and ways of the female (cf. Dhs §633).
11. The masculinity faculty has the male sex as its characteristic. Its function is
to show that "this is a male." It is manifested as the reason for the mark, sign,
work, and ways of the male (cf. Dhs §634).
Both these last are coextensive with the whole body, as body-sensitivity is. But
it does not follow that they have to be called either "located in the space where
body-sensitivity is located" or "located in the space where that is not located."
Like the natures of visible data, etc., these are not confoundable one with the
other.24
23.	Upadinna (also upadinnaka) is pp. of npadiyati (he clings), from which the noun
upadana (clinging) also comes. Upadinna-(ka-)rupa (clung-to matter) = kammaja-rupa
(kamma-born matter): see Dhs §653. It is vaguely renderable by "organic or sentient
or living matter"; technically it is matter of the four primaries that is "clung to"
(upadinna) or "derived" (upadaya) by kamma. Generally taken as a purely Abhidhamma
term (Dhs 1), it nevertheless occurs in the Suttas at M I 185 in the same sense.
24.	Ee reads annamamiam sankaro natthi. Ae omits sankaro natthi. The word sartkara in
the sense of "confounding" or "error" is not in PED; see Vism concluding verses, PTS

59. 12. The life facility has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of
matter. Its function is to make them occur. It is manifested in the establishing of
their presence. Its proximate cause is primary elements that are to be sustained.
And although it has the capacity consisting in the characteristic of maintaining,
etc., yet it only maintains conascent kinds of matter at the moment of presence, as
water does lotuses and so on. Though states (dhamma) arise due to their own
conditions, it maintains them, as a wet-nurse does a prince. And it occurs itself
only through its connection with the states that occur, like a pilot; it does not
cause occurrence after dissolution, because of its own absence and that of what
has to be made to occur. It does not prolong presence at the moment of dissolution
because it is itself dissolving, like the flame of a lamp when the wick and the oil
are getting used up. But it must not be regarded as destitute of power to maintain,
make occur, and make present, because it does accomplish each of these functions
at the moment stated (cf. Dhs §635).25
--
"Though these things, that is to say, the 'mark ... of the female/ etc., arise each due
to its own condition consisting in kamma, etc., they mostly only do so as modes in a
continuity accompanied by the femininity faculty. And so 'it is manifested as the
reason for the mark/ etc., is said making the femininity faculty their cause.
"As regards the 'mark of the female/ etc., too, its 'facultiness' is stated as
predominance, in other words, as a state of cause, because the conditions for the
modal matter (akara-rupa) consisting of the mark of the female, etc., in a continuity
accompanied bv faculties do not arise otherwise, and because these kinds of materiality
are a condition for apprehending the female. But because the femininity faculty does
not generate even the material instances in its own group or maintain or consolidate
them, and because it does not so act for the material instances of other groups, it is
therefore not called in the text faculty presence, and non-disappearance conditions, as
the life faculty is for the material instances of its group, and as nutriment is for the material
instances in succeeding groups. And it is because the mark, etc., are dependent on other
conditions that wherever thev have predominance its shape is encountered, even in dead
and sculptured matter that resembles it. And so too with the masculinity faculty
"And since these two do not occur together in a single continuity, because of the
words, 'Does the masculinity faculty arise in one in whom the femininity faculty
arises?—No' (Yamaka), etc., therefore even in a hermaphrodite there is only one of
them at a given moment (see also Dhs-a 323)" (Vism-mht 448).
25. "Since the life faculty is itself entirely kamma-born it is established, by taking
them as conascent, that the things to be protected by it are kamma-born too; this is
why there is no inclusion of the term 'kamma-born.' It maintains as if it were its own
that kamma-born matter by being the cause of its occurrence even though only lasting
for a moment; that is why it has the characteristic of maintaining conascent kinds of
matter. For kamma alone is not competent to be the cause of kamma-born tilings"
presence, as nutriment, etc., are of the nutriment-born. Why? Because it is no longer
existent at that moment.
"'Because it does accomplish each of those functions': it does so because it is a
condition for distinguishing what is living. For it is the life faculty that distinguishes
matter that is bound up with faculties from dead matter, and kamma-born matter and
what is bound up with that from matter that is temperature originated, and so on.

60. 13. The heart-basis has the characteristic of being the (material) support for the
mind-element and for the mind-consciousness-element. Its function is to observe
them. It is manifested as the carrying of them. It is to be found in dependence on the
blood, of the kind described in the treatise on mindfulness of the bodv (VIII.Ill),
inside the heart. It is assisted by the primaries with their functions of upholding,
etc.; it is consolidated by temperature, consciousness, and nutriment; it is maintained
by life; and it serves as physical basis for the mind-element and mind-consciousness-
element, and for the states associated with them.26
--
"And the life faculty must be regarded as the reason not only for presence during
a moment but also for non-interruption of connection; otherwise death as the
termination of a life span would be illogical" (Vism-mht 448).
26. "'The heart-basis ... the support for the mind-element and for the mind-
consciousness-element': how is that to be known? (i) From scriptures and (ii) from
logical reasoning.
"The scripture is this: The materiality dependent on which the mind-element and
mind-consciousness-element occur is a condition, as a support condition, for the
mind-element and the mind-consciousness-element and what is associated therewith'
(Patth 1.4). If that is so, why is it not mentioned in the Rupakanda of the
Dhammasangani? (Dhs §583ff.). Its not being mentioned there is for another reason.
What is that? Non-inconsistency of the teaching. For while eye consciousness, etc.,
have the eye, etc., as their respective supports absolutely, mind-consciousness does
not in the same way have the heart-basis as its support absolutely. And the teaching
in the physical-basis dyad (vattlm-duka) is given by way of the material support thus,
There is matter that is the physical basis of eye-consciousness, there is matter that is
not the physical basis of eye-consciousness' (Dhs §585) and so on; and if the dyads
were stated by way of what had the heart-basis absolutely as its support thus, There
is matter that is the physical basis of mind-consciousness' and so on, then the object
dyads (ararmmna-duka) do not fall into line: for on|e cannot say: There is matter that is
the object of mind-consciousness, there is matter that is not the object of mind-
consciousness.' So the physical-basis dyads and object dyads being thus made
inconsistent, the teaching would lack unity, and the Master's wish was to give the
teaching here in a form that has unity. That is why the heart-basis is not mentioned,
not because it is unapprehendable.
"(ii) But the logical reasoning should be understood in this way. In the five constituent
becoming, [that is, in the sense sphere and fine-material sphere,] these two elements
have as their support produced (nvpphamm) derived matter. Herein, since the visible-
data base, etc., and nutritive essence, are found to occur apart from what is bound up
with faculties, to make them the support would be illogical. And since these two
elements are found in a continuity that is devoid of the femininity and masculinity
faculties [i.e. in the Brahma-world], to make them the support would be illogical too.
And in the case of the life faculty that would have to have another function, so to make
it the support would be illogical too. So it is the heart-basis that remains to be recognized
as their support. For it is possible to say that these two elements have as their support
produced derived matter, since existence is bound up with matter in the five-constituent
becoming. Whatever has its existence bound up with matter is found to have as its
support produced derived matter, as the eye-consciousness-element does. And the
distinction 'in the five-constituent becoming' is made on account of the mind-
consciousness-element; in the four-constituent becoming, [that is, the immaterial

in the consciousness-originated air element that causes the occurrence of moving
forward, etc., which mode and alteration are a condition for the stiffening, upholding,
and moving of the conascent material body: [448] Its function is to display intention.
It is manifested as the cause of bodily excitement. Its proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated air element. But it is called "bodily intimation" (kaya-
vinnatti) because it is the cause of the intimating (vinnapana) of intention by means
of bodily excitement, and because it is itself intimatable through the body in other
words, through that bodily excitement. Moving forward, etc., should be understood
to occur owing to the movement of the [kinds of matter] that are temperature-born,
etc., which are interlocked with the consciousness-born kinds moved by that

sphere,] there is no mind-element. Does there not follow contradiction of the middle
term (hetn) because of establishing faculties as their support? No; because that is
disproved by what is seen. For these two elements are not, as in the case of eye-
consciousness, controlled by the slackness and keenness, etc., of their physical basis;
and accordingly it is not said in the texts that they have the faculties as their condition.
Hence their having faculties as their support, in other words, their being controlled by
them, is disproved.
"Granted that these two elements have as their support the derived matter consisting
of the heart-basis, how is it to be known that it is kamma-originated, has an invariable
function, and is to be found located in the heart? It may be said to be kamma-originated
because, like the eye, it is the materiality of a physical basis; and because of that it has
an invariable function; because it is the materiality of a physical basis and because it is
a support for consciousness, is the meaning. It is known that its location is there
because of the heart's exhaustion (khijjana) in one who thinks of anything, bringing it
to mind intently and directing his whole mind to it" (Vism-mht 449-50).
The word hadaya (heart), used in a purely mental and not physical sense, occurs in
the definitions of the mind-element and mind-consciousness-element in the Vibhanga
(Vibh 88-89). The brain (matthalimga), which seems to have been first added as the
32nd part of the bodv in the Patisambhida (Patis 17), was ignored, and the Visuddhimagga
is hard put to it to find a use for it. The Pitakas (e.g. Pattli 1,4 quoted above) connect the
mind with the matter of the body without specifying.
27. "It is the mode and the alteration of what? Of consciousness-originated primary
elements that have the air-element in excess of capability What is that capability? It is
the state of being consciousness-born and the state of being derived matter. Or
alternatively, it can be taken as the mode alteration of the air element. If that is so, then
intimation is illogical as derived matter, for there is no derived matter with a single
primary as its support, since 'matter derived from the four great primaries' (M153) is
said. That is not wrong. Alteration of one of the four is that of all four, as with wealth
shared among four. And excess of air element in a material group (kalapa) does not
contradict the words 'of the air element'; and excess is in capability, not in quantity
otherwise their inseparability would be illogical. According to some it is that of the air
element only. In their opinion the state of derived matter is inapplicable (durupapada)
to intimation, since the alteration of one is not that of all. But this [air element] is
apprehended by mind-door impulsion that is next to the non-intimating [apprehension]
that is next to the apprehension of the appearance of motion in the movement of the
`449
hands, and so on. There is a certain kind of alteration that is separate from the
appearance of motion. And the apprehension of the former is next to the apprehension
of the latter. How is that to be known? By the apprehension of intention. For no
apprehension of intention such as, 'He is getting this done, it seems' is met with in the
case of trees' movements, etc., which are devoid of intention. But it is met with in the
case of hand movements and so on. Therefore there is a certain kind of alteration that
is separate from the appearance of motion, and it is known as the 'intimator of the
intention.' Also it is known by inference that the apprehension of the alteration is next
to the apprehension of the appearance thus: The intimator intimates the meaning to
be intimated only when it is apprehended as a cause, not merely as present. For they
say accordingly:
Sounds that have entered no objective field
Do not awaken any kind of meaning;
And also beings merely recognized
As such communicate no meanings either.
"If just the apprehension of the alteration is the reason for the apprehension of the
intention, why is there no apprehension of intention in unapprehended communication
(sanketa)l It is not only just the apprehension of the alteration that is the reason for the
apprehension of the intention; but rather it should be taken that the apprehension of
the previously-established connection is the decisive support for this. The stiffening,
upholding, and movement are due to the air-element associated with the alteration
belonging to the intimation, is what is said. What, is it all the air-element that does all
those things? It is not like that. For it is the air element given rise to by the seventh
impulsion that, by acquiring as its reinforcing conditions the air elements given rise to
by the preceding impulsions, moves consciousness-originated matter by acting as
cause for its successive arisings in adjacent locations, (desantaruppatti—cf. Ch. VIII, n.
54) not the others. The others, however, help it by doing the stiffening and upholding,
the successive arising in adjacent locations being itself the movement. So the
instrumentality should be taken as attributed when there is the sign [of movement];
otherwise there would not be uninterestedness and momentariness of dhammas.
And here the cart to be drawn by seven yokes is given as simile in the Commentary
But when consciousness-born matter moves, the kinds of matter born of temperature,
kamma, and nutriment move too because they are bound up with it, like a piece of dry
cow-dimg thrown into a river's current.
"Since it has been said that the apprehension of intimation is next to the
apprehension of the appearance of motion, how then, is the air element itself as the
maker of the movement accompanied bv the alteration consisting in the intimation? It
is not like that. It is the air elements given rise to by the first impulsion, etc., and which
are unable to cause movement in that way and perform only the stiffening and
upholding, that should be taken as only accompanied by the alteration belonging to
intimation. For it is the alteration coexistent with the intention that is the intimation,
because of giving rise to alteration in whatever direction it wishes to cause the
occurrence of moving forward and so on. Taking it in this way, it is perfectly logical to
say that the origination of intimation belongs to mind-door adverting. Since the
intention possessed of the aforesaid alteration is intimated through the apprehension
of that alteration, it is said that Tts function is to display intention.' The air element
being the cause of the motion of the bodily intimation, is figuratively said, as a state of
alteration, to be 'manifested as the cause of bodily motion.' Tts proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated air-element' is said since the air element's excessive function

62.	15. Verbal intimation is the mode (conformation) and the alteration
(deformation) in the consciousness-originated earth element that causes that
occurrence of speech utterance which mode and alteration are a condition for
the knocking together of clung-to matter.28 Its function is to display intention. It
is manifested as the cause of the voice in speech. Its proximate cause is the
consciousness-originated earth element. But it is called "verbal intimation"
because it is the cause of the intimating of intention by means of the voice in
speech, and because it is itself intimatable through speech, in other words,
through that voice in speech. For, just as, on seeing a sign for water consisting of
an ox skull, etc., hung up in the forest, it is intimated that "there is water here,"
so too, on noticing either the bodily shaking or the voice in speech thus, they
intimate.29 (See Dhs §637.)
63.	16. The space element has the characteristic of delimiting matter. Its function
is to display the boundaries of matter. It is manifested as the confines of matter;
or it is manifested as untouchedness, as the state of gaps and apertures (cf. Dhs
§638). Its proximate cause is the matter delimited. And it is on account of it that
one can say of material things delimited that "this is above, below, around, that."
64.	17. Lightness of matter has the characteristic of non-slowness. Its function is
to dispel heaviness of matter. It is manifested as light transformability Its
proximate cause is light matter (cf. Dhs §639).
18.	Malleability of matter has the characteristic of non-stiffenedness. Its function
is to dispel stiffness of matter. It is manifested as non-opposition to any kind of
action. Its proximate cause is malleable matter (cf. Dhs §640).
19.	Wieldiness of matter has the characteristic of wieldiness that is favourable
to bodily action. Its function is to dispel unwieldiness. It is manifested as non-
weakness. Its proximate cause is wieldy matter (cf. Dhs §641).
65.	These three, however, are not found apart from each other. Still their
difference may be understood as follows. Lightness of matter is alteration of matter
such as any light (agile) state in material instances, as in one who is healthy any
--
is the cause of intimating intention by movement of the body" (Vism-mht 450-52). Cf.
Dhs-a 83f.
28.	Vaclbheda—"speech utterance" is not in PED, which does not give this use of
bheda. Vism-mht (p. 452) explains: "The function (—'knocking together') of the vocal
apparatus (—'clung-to matter')."
29.	"The question, Tt is the mode and the alteration of what?,' should be handled in
the same way as for bodily intimation, with this difference: for 'next to the apprehension
of the appearance of movement' substitute 'next to the hearing of an audible sound.'
And here, because of the absence of stiffening, etc., the argument beginning, 'For it is
the air element given rise to by the seventh impulsion' does not apply; for the sound
arises together with the knocking together, and the knocking together only applies in
the case of the first impulsion, and so on. The knocking together is the arising of
groups of primaries (bliuta-kalapa) in proximity to each other due to conditions. The
movement is the progression of the successive arising in adjacent locations. This is the
difference. The earth element's knocking together is parallel to the air element's
moving as regards function" (Vism-mht 452).
`451
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
non-slowness, any manner of light transformability in them, which is originated
by conditions that prevent any disturbance of elements capable of creating
sluggishness of matter. Malleability of matter is alteration of matter such as any
malleable state in material instances, as in a well-pounded hide, any pliable
manner consisting in amenableness to exercise of power over them in all kinds
of work without distinction, which [449] is originated by conditions that prevent
any disturbance of elements capable of creating stiffness of matter. Wieldiness of
matter is alteration of matter such as any wieldy state in material instances, as in
well-refined gold, any manner in them consisting in favourableness to the work
of the body which is originated by conditions that prevent any disturbance of
elements capable of creating unfavourableness to the work of the body
66. 20. Growth of matter has the characteristic of setting up. Its function is to
make material instances emerge in the first instance. It is manifested as launching;
or it is manifested as the completed state. Its proximate cause is grown matter.
21. Continuity of matter has the characteristic of occurrence. Its function is to
anchor. It is manifested as non-interruption. Its proximate cause is matter that is
to be anchored.
Both of these are terms for matter at its birth; but owing to difference of mode,
and according to [different persons'] susceptibility to instruction, the teaching
in the summary (uddesa) in the DhammasanganI is given as "growth and
continuity" (cf. Dhs §596); but since there is here no difference in meaning,
consequently in the description (niddesa) of these words, "the setting up of the
sense-bases is the growth of matter" and "the growth of matter is the continuity
of matter" is said (Dhs §642, 732, 865).
67. And in the Commentary after saying, "It is genesis that is called 'setting
up,' increase that is called 'growth,' occurrence that is called 'continuity'" this
simile is given: "Genesis as setting up is like the time when water comes up in a
hole dug in a river bank; increase as growth is like the time when it fills [the
hole]; occurrence as continuity is like the time when it overflows." And at the end
of the simile it is said: "So what is stated? Setting up is stated by sense-base;
sense-base is stated by setting up." Consequently, it is the first genesis of material
instances that is their setting up; the genesis also of others that are generated in
addition to those is growth since it appears in the aspect of increase; the repeated
genesis also of others that are generated in addition to those is continuity since it
appears in the aspect of anchoring. This is how it should be understood to have
been declared thus.
68. 22. Ageing has the characteristic of maturing (ripening) material instances.
Its function is to lead on towards [their termination]. It is manifested as the loss
of newness without the loss of individual essence, like oldness in paddy Its
proximate cause is matter that is maturing (ripening). This is said with reference
to the kind of ageing that is evident through seeing alteration in teeth, etc., as
their brokenness, and so on (cf. Dhs §644). But that of immaterial states, which
has no such [visible] alteration, is called hidden ageing. And that in earth, water,
rocks, the moon, the sun, etc., is called incessant ageing. [450]
`452
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
69.	23. Impermanence of matter has the characteristic of complete breaking up.
Its function is to make material instances subside. It is manifested as destruction
and fall (cf. Dhs §645). Its proximate cause is matter that is completely breaking
up.
70.	24. Physical nutriment has the characteristic of nutritive essence. Its function
is to feed kinds of matter. It is manifested as consolidating. Its proximate cause is
a physical basis that must be fed with physical food. It is a term for the nutritive
essence by means of which living beings sustain themselves (cf. Dhs §646).
71.	These, firstly are the material instances that have been handed down in the
texts.30 But in the Commentary others have been added as follows: matter as
power, matter as procreation, matter as birth, matter as sickness; and, in the
opinion of some, matter as torpor.31
In the first place, matter as torpor is rejected as non-existent by the words:
Surely thou art a sage enlightened,
There are no hindrances in thee (Sn 541).
As to the rest, matter as sickness is included by ageing and by impermanence;
matter as birth by growth and continuity; matter as procreation, by the water element;
and matter as power by the air element. So taken separately not even one of these
exists: this was the agreement reached.
So this derived matter of twenty-four sorts and the aforesaid matter of the
primary elements, which is of four sorts, together amount to twenty-eight sorts,
neither more nor less.
72.	And all that [matter of twenty-eight sorts] is of one kind as "not-root-cause,
root-causeless, dissociated from root-cause, with conditions, mundane, subject
to cankers" (Dhs §584), and so on.
It is of two kinds as internal and external, gross and subtle, far and near,
produced (nipphanna) and unproduced, sensitive matter and insensitive matter,
faculty and non-faculty clung to and not-clung to, and so on.
73.	Herein, the five kinds beginning with the eye are internal because they
occur as an integral part of the selfhood (in oneself); the rest are external because
thev are external to that selfhood (personality). The nine beginning with the eve
and the three elements excepting the water element, making twelve kinds in all,
are to be taken as gross because of impinging; the rest are subtle because they are
the opposite of that. What is subtle is far because it is difficult to penetrate, the
other is near because it is easy to penetrate. The eighteen kinds of matter, that is
to say, the four elements, the thirteen beginning with the eye, and physical
nutriment, are produced because they can be discerned through their own
individual essences, having exceeded the [purely conceptual] states of [matter
as] delimitation, [matter as] alteration, and [matter as] characteristic (see §77);
the rest, being the opposite, are unproduced. The five kinds beginning with the

mht 455). A long discussion on this follows in Vism-mht, not given here.

Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
eye are sensitive matter through their being conditions for the apprehension of
visible data, etc., because thev are, as it were, bright like the surface of a looking
glass; the rest are insensitive matter because they are the opposite of that. [451]
Sensitive matter itself, together with the three beginning with the femininity
faculty is faculty in the sense of predominance; the rest are not-faculty because
they are the opposite of that. What we shall later describe as "kamma-born" (§75
and XX.27) is clung to because that is "clung to," [that is, acquired] by kamma.
The rest are not-clung to because they are the opposite of that.
74. Again, all matter is of three kinds according to the visible (sanidassana)
triad, the kamma-born triad, etc. (see Dhs 2). Herein, as regards the gross, a
visible datum is visible with impact; the rest are invisible with impact; all the
subtle kinds are invisible without impact. So firstly it is of three kinds according
to the visible triad.
75.	According to the kamma-born triad, etc., however, that born from kamma is
kamma-born; that born from a condition other than that is not-kamma-born; that
not born from anything is neither-kamma-born-nor-not-kamma-born.
That born from consciousness is consciousness-born; that born from a condition
other than consciousness is not-consciousness-born; that not born from anything
is neither-consciousness-born-nor-not-consciousness-born.
That born from nutriment is nutriment-born; that born from a condition other
than that is not-nutriment-born; that not born from anything is neither-nutriment-
born-nor-not-nutriment-born.
That born from temperature is temperature-born; that born from a condition
other than that is not-temperature-born; that not born from anything is neither-
temperature-born-nor-not-temperature-born.
So it is of three kinds according to the kamma-born triad, and so on.
76.	Again, it is of four kinds as seen, etc., as concrete matter, etc., and as the
physical basis tetrads, and so on.
Herein, the visible-data base is seen because it is the objective field of seeing.
The sound base is heard because it is the objective field of hearing. The three, that
is to say, odours, flavours, and tangible data, are sensed (lit. contacted) because
they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous [objective fields].
The rest are cognized because they are the objective field of consciousness
(cognition) only. So firstly it is of four kinds according to the seen, etc., tetrad.32
--
32. Sensed (muta)' means apprehendable by sensing (mutva), by reaching; hence
he said 'because they are the objective fields of faculties that take contiguous [objective fields]'
(cf. §46). But what is it that is called a tangible datum? It is the three elements, earth,
heat, and air. But why is the water element not included here? Is not cold apprehended
by touching; and that is the water element? Certainly it is apprehended but it is not the
water element. What is it then? It is just the fire element. For there is the sensation
(buddhi) of cold when heat is sluggish. There is no quality that is called cold; there is
only the assumption (abhimana) of coldness due to the sluggishness of the state of
heat. How is that to be known? Because of the unreliability of the sensation of cold,
`454
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
77.	Here, however, "produced matter" is concrete matter; the space-element is
delimiting matter; those from "bodily intimation" up to "wieldiness" are matter as
alteration; birth, ageing and dissolution are matter as characteristic. So it is of four
kinds as concrete matter and so on.
78.	Here, however, what is called the materiality of the heart is physical basis, not
door (see Dhs-a 82f.); the two intimations are door, not physical basis; sensitive
matter is both physical basis and door; the rest are neither physical basis nor door. So
it is four kinds according to the physical basis tetrad.
79.	Again, it is of five kinds as born of one, born of two, born of three, born of
four, and not born of anything.
Herein, what is kamma-born only or consciousness-born only is called born
of one. Of these, materiality of the faculties, together with the heart-basis, is kamma-
born only; the two intimations are consciousness-born only But what is born
[now] of consciousness and fnowl of temperature is called born of two. That is the
sound base only.33 What is born of temperature, consciousness, and nutriment
--
like 'beyond and not beyond/ For in hot weather, while those who stand in the sun
and go into the shade have the sensation of cold, yet those who go to the same place
from an underground cave have the sensation of heat. And if coldness were the water
element it would be found in a single group (kalapa) along with heat; but it is not so
found. That is why it may be known that coldness is not the water element. And that
is conclusive (uttara) for those who agree to the inseparable existence of the primary
elements; and it is conclusive too even for those who do not agree because it is
disproved by associate existence through seeing the functions of the four primaries in
a single group. It is conclusive too for those who say that coldness is the characteristic
of the air element; for if coldness were the air element, coldness would be found in a
single group along with heat, and it is not so found. That is why it may be known that
coldness is not the air element either. But those who hold the opinion that fluidity
(dravata) is the water element and that that is apprehended bv touching should be told:
That fluidity touched is merely the venerable ones' assumption as is the case with
shape.' For this is said by the Ancients:
Three elements coexisting with fluidity
Together form what constitutes a tangible;
That "I succeed in touching this fluidity"
Is a common misconception in the world.
And as a man who touches elements,
And apprehends a shape then with his mind,
Fancies "I really have been touching shape,"
So too fluidity is recognized'" (Vism-mht 459).
33. "'The sound base only': here some say 'The consciousness-born is always
intimative (savinnattika)/ The Ancients say 'There is sound due to the intervention
(vipphara) of applied thought that does not intimate.' While depending on the word of
the Great Commentary that puts it thus, 'Intimatable (cognizable) through the ear by
means of the sound due to applied thought's intervention,' still there is also need of
the arising of consciousness-originated sound without intimation (cognition) for
because of the words, 'For the intimation (cognition) is not due to intimating speech'
(?), it arises together with sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. That
`455
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
[452] is called born of three. But that is the three beginning with "lightness" only.
What is born from the four beginning with kamma is called born of four. That is
all the rest except "matter as characteristic."
80. But "matter as characteristic" is called not born of anything. Why? Because
there is no arising of arising, and the other two are the mere maturing and
breakup of what has arisen. Though in the passage, "The visible-data base, the
sound base, the odour base, the flavour base, the tangible-data base, the space
element, the water element, lightness of matter, malleability of matter, wiejldiness
of matter, growth of matter, continuity of matter, and physical food—these states
are consciousness-originated" (cf. Dhs §667) and so on, a state of birth [that is,
growth] being born from somewhere can be understood as allowable since the
point of view here is the moment when the conditions that are giving birth to the
kinds of materiality are exercising their function.
This, firstly, is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the
materiality aggregate.
[The Consciousness Aggregate]
81. Among the remaining aggregates, however, whatever has the characteristic
of being felt34 should be understood, all taken together, as the feeling aggregate;
and whatever has the characteristic of perceiving, all taken together, as the
perception aggregate; and whatever has the characteristic of forming, all taken
together, as the formations aggregate; and whatever has the characteristic of
cognizing, all taken together, as the consciousness aggregate. Herein, since the
rest are easy to understand when the consciousness aggregate has been
--
being so, there would have to be a consciousness-born sound-ennead. And that theory
is rejected by Sanghakaras who imagine that it is self-contradictory to say that there
is sound not intimatable (cognizable) through the ear. Others, however, do not reject
the Great Commentary's statement and they comment on its intention. How? [They
say that] the non-intimation (non-cognition) through the ear of the sound activated
due to applied thought's intervention is stated in the Suttas with this intention, 'He
tells by hearing with the divine ear the subtle sound that is conascent with the
intimation, originated by applied thought, and consisting in movement of the tongue and
palate, and so on' (cf. A I 171), and that in the Patthana (Patth 1, 7) the state of object
condition for ear-consciousness is stated with reference to gross sound" (Vism-mht 460).
34. "'Has the characteristic of being felt' means that it has as its characteristic what is
felt, what is experienced as the 'taste (stimulus)' of the object. 'Characteristic of perceiving'
means that it has as its characteristic the perceiving of an object classed as blue, etc.,
and the knowing, the apprehending, of it by arousing the perception of it as blue,
yellow, long, short, and so on. Forming (abhisaukharana) is accumulating, or it is
contriving by becoming interested. And it is because volition is basic in both of these
ways that the formations aggregate is said thus to have the characteristic of forming. For
in expounding the formations aggregate in the Suttanta-Bhajaniya of the Vibhahga,
volition was expounded by the Blessed One thus, 'Eye-contact-born volition' (Vibh 8)
and so on.'Has the characteristic of cognizing' means that it has as its characteristic that
kind of knowing called apprehension of an object in a mode in which the objective field
is apprehended differently from the mode of perceiving" (Vism-mht 462).
`456
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
understood, we shall therefore begin with the commentary on the consciousness
aggregate.
82.	"Whatever has the characteristic of cognizing should be understood, all
taken together, as the consciousness aggregate" was said above. And what has
the characteristic of cognizing (vijanana)? Consciousness (vinnana); according
as it is said, "It cognizes, friend, that is why 'consciousness' is said" (M I 292).
The words vinnana (consciousness), citta (mind, consciousness), and mano (mind)
are one in meaning.
[The 89 Kinds of Consciousness—see Table III]
That same [consciousness], though one in its individual essence with the
characteristic of cognizing, is threefold according to kind, namely, (I) profitable,
(II) unprofitable, and (III) indeterminate.35
83.	I. Herein, the profitable is fourfold according to plane, namely (A) of the
sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere, and (D)
supramundane.36
--
35. Profitable in the sense of health, blamelessness, and pleasant result (see Vism-
mht 463). Unprofitable in the opposite sense. Indeterminate because not describable as
either profitable or unprofitable (see Vism-mht 464). This is the first of the twenty-
two triads in the Abhidhamma Matika (Dhs 1).
Pali has five principal words, nama, vinnana, mano, cittar and ceto, against the normal
English consciousness and mind. While their etymology can be looked up in the
dictionary one or two points need noting here. Nama (rendered by "mentality" when
not used to refer to a name) is almost confined in the sense considered to the expression
ndma-rupa ("mentality-materiality") as the fourth member of the dependent origination,
where it comprises the three mental aggregates of feeling, perception and formations,
but not that of consciousness (vinnana). Vinnana (rendered by "consciousness") is,
loosely, more or less a synonym for mano and citta; technically, it is bare cognition
considered apart from feeling, perception or formations. Mano (rendered by "mind"),
when used technically is confined to the sixth internal base for contact (Ch. XV). Citta
(rendered by "mind" and "consciousness" or "[manner of] consciousness"), when
used technically, refers to a momentary type-situation considered as vinrtana in relation
to the tone of its concomitant feeling, perception and formations. Possibly, a better
rendering would have been "cognizance" throughout. It carries a flavour of its
etymological relative, cetana ("volition"). Ceto (another etymological relative, rendered
by "heart"—i.e. "seat of the emotions,"—"will" or "mind"), when used loosely is
very near to citta; but technically it is restricted to one or two such expressions as ceto-
vinmtti ("mind-deliverance" or "heart-deliverance").
36. "'Sense sphere' (kamavacara): here there are the two kinds of sense desire (kama),
sense desire as basis (vattlin-kdrna) and sense desire as defilement (kilesakania). Of
these, sense desire as [objective] basis particularized as the five cords of sense desire
(paiica-kama-guna = dimensions of sensual desires), is desired (kaniiyati). Sense desire
as defilement, which is craving, desires (kameti). The sense sphere (kamavacara) is
where these two operate (avacaranti) together. But what is that? It is the elevenfold
sense-desire becoming, i.e. hell, asura demons, ghosts, animals, human beings, and
six sensual-sphere heavens. So too with the fine-material sphere and the immaterial
sphere, taking "fine-material" as craving for the fine-material too, and "immaterial" as
`457
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
I. A. Herein, (l)-(8) that of the sense sphere is eightfold, being classified
according to joy, equanimity knowledge, and prompting, that is to say: (1) when
accompanied-by-joy it is either associated-with-knowledge and unprompted,
or (2) prompted; or (3) it is dissociated-from-knowledge and likewise
[unprompted, or (4) prompted]; and (5) when accompanied-by-equanimity it is
either associated-with-knowledge and prompted, or (6) unprompted; or (7) it is
dissociated-from-knowledge [453] and likewise [unprompted, or (8) prompted].
84. (1) When a man is happy on encountering an excellent gift to be given, or
recipient, etc., or some such cause for joy, and by placing right view foremost
that occurs in the way beginning "There is [merit in] giving" (M I 288), he
unhesitatingly and unurged by others performs such merit as giving, etc., then
his consciousness is accompanied by joy, associated with knowledge; and unprompted.
(2) But when a man is happy and content in the way aforesaid, and, while
placing right view foremost, yet he does it hesitantly through lack of free
generosity, etc., or urged on by others, then his consciousness is of the same kind
as the last but prompted; for in this sense "prompting" is a term for a prior effort
exerted by himself or others
85.	(3) But when young children have a natural habit due to seeing the behav-
iour of relatives and are joyful on seeing bhikkhus and at once give them whatever
they have in their hands or pay homage, then the third kind of consciousness
arises. (4) But when they behave like this on being urged by their relatives, "Give;
pay homage," then the fourth kind of consciousness arises. (5)-(8) But when the
consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances through encountering
no excellence in the gift to be given, or in the recipient, etc., or through want of
any such cause for joy, then the remaining four, which are accompanied by
equanimity, arise.
So sense-sphere profitable [consciousness] should be understood as of eight
kinds, being classed according to joy, equanimity knowledge, and prompting.
86.	I. B. The consciousness of the fine-material sphere is fivefold, being classed
according to association with the jhana factors. That is to say (9) the first is
associated with applied thought, sustained thought, happiness, bliss, and
concentration. (10) the second leaves out a no applied thought from that. (11) the
third leaves out sustained thought from that, (12) the fourth makes happiness
fade away from that, (13) the fifth is associated with equanimity and
concentration, bliss having subsided.
87.	I. C. That of the immaterial sphere is fourfold by association with the four
immaterial states; for (14) the first is associated with the jhana of the base
consisting of boundless space in the way aforesaid, while (15)-(17) the second,
third, and fourth, are [respectively] associated with those of the base consisting
of boundless consciousness, and so on.
88.	I. D. The supramundane is fourfold (18)-(21) bv association with the four paths.
craving for the immaterial too. It crosses over (uttarati) from the world (loka), thus it is
supramundane (lokuttara)" (Vism-mht 464).
`458

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
So firstly profitable consciousness itself is of twenty-one kinds. [454]
89.	II. The unprofitable is one kind according to plane, being only of the sense
sphere. It is of three kinds according to root, as (a) rooted in greed, (b) rooted in
hate, and (c) rooted in delusion.
90.	II. (a) Herein, (22)-(29) that rooted in greed is of eight kinds, being classed
according to joy equanimity [false] view, and prompting, that is to say: (22) when
accompanied by joy it is either associated-with-[false-]view and unprompted, or
(23) prompted; or (24) it is dissociated-from-[false-]view and likewise [unprompted
or (25) prompted]; and (26) when accompanied-by-equanimity it is either associated-
with-[false-] view and unprompted, or (27) prompted; or (28) it is dissociated-from-
[false-]view and likewise [unprompted, or (29) prompted].
91.	(22) When a man is happy and content in placing wrong view foremost of
the sort beginning "There is no danger in sense desires" (M I 307), and either
enjoys sense desires with consciousness that in its own individual essence is
eager without being urged, or believes auspicious sights, etc., have a [real
substantial] core, then the first kind of unprofitable consciousness arises (23);
when it is with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on, then it is the
second kind (24). But when a man is happy and content only, without placing
wrong view foremost, and indulges in sexual intercourse, or covets others' good
fortune, or steals others' goods, with consciousness that in its own individual
essence is eager without being urged, then it is the third kind (25). When it is
with consciousness that is sluggish and urged on, then it is the fourth kind
(26)-(29). But when the consciousnesses are devoid of joy in these four instances
through encountering no excellence in the sense desires, or through want of
any such cause for joy, then the remaining four, which are accompanied by
equanimity arise.
So that rooted in greed should be understood as of eight kinds, being classed
according to jov, equanimity [false] view and prompting.
92. II. (b) That rooted in hate is of two kinds: (30)-(31) being accompanied-by-grief
and associated-with-resentment, it is either prompted or unprompted. It should be
understood to occur at the times when [consciousness] is either keen [if
unprompted] or sluggish [if prompted] in the killing of living things, and so on.
93.	II. (c) That rooted in delusion is of two kinds: (32)-(33) being accompanied-by-
ecjuanimity, it is either associated-with uncertainty or associated-with-agitation.
It should be understood to occur at the time of indecision or of distraction.
So unprofitable consciousness is of twelve kinds.
94.	III. The indeterminate is of two kinds: (i) resultant and (ii) functional. Herein,
III. i. resultant is of four kinds according to plane; namely (A) of the sense sphere,
(B) of the fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere, and (D)
supramundane. Herein, III. i. A. that of the sense sphere is of two kinds, namely (a)
profitable result and (b) unprofitable result. And III. i. A. (a) the profitable resultant
is of two kinds, namely (1) without root-cause and (2) with root-cause.
95.	III. i. A. (a) i. Herein, that without root-cause is that devoid of non-greed, etc.,
as the cause of result. It is of eight kinds as (34) eye-consciousness (35)-(38),
`459
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
ear-, nose-, tongue-, and bodv-consciousness (39), mind-element with the
function of receiving (40)-(41), the two mind-consciousness-elements with the
functions of investigating, and so on. [455]
96.	Herein, (34) eye-consciousness has the characteristic of being supported by
the eye and cognizing visible data. Its function is to have only visible data as its
object. It is manifested as occupation with visible data. Its proximate cause is the
departure of (70) the functional mind-element that has visible data as its object.
(35)-(38) Ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-consciousness [respectively] have the
characteristic of being supported bv the ear, etc., and of cognizing sounds, and
so on. Their functions are to have only sounds, etc., as their [respective] objects.
They are manifested as occupation with [respectively] sounds, and so on. Their
proximate cause is the departure of (70) the functional mind-element that has
[respectively] sounds, etc., as its object.
97.	(39) [The resultant] mind-element has the characteristic of cognizing
[respectively] visible data, etc., immediately next to (34)-(38) eye-consciousness,
and so on. Its function is to receive visible data, and so on. It is manifested as the
state [of receiving] corresponding to that [last-mentioned function].37 Its proximate
cause is the departure of eye-consciousness, and so on.
(40)-(41) Also the twofold resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-
cause with the function of investigating, etc., has as its characteristic the
cognizing of the six kinds of objects. Its function is that of investigating, and so
on. It is manifested as the state [of investigating] corresponding to that [last-
mentioned function]. Its proximate cause is the heart-basis.
98. But it is classed according to its association with joy or with equanimity
and according to its being divisible into that with two positions and that with
five positions [in the cognitive series]. For of these, (40) one is associated-with-
joy because of its presence when entirely desirable objects occur; and it has two
positions [in the cognitive series] because it occurs as investigating at the five
doors and as registration at the end of impulsion. (41) The other kind is
associated-with-equanimity because of its presence when desirable-neutral
objects occur, and it has five positions since it occurs as investigation, registration,
rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.
99. And this eightfold resultant consciousness without root-cause is of two kinds
as well because of having an invariable object and a variable object. It is of three
kinds as classed according to [bodily] pleasure, [mental] joy and equanimity For
(34)-(38) the five consciousnesses have each an invariable object since they occur
respectively only with respect to visible data, and so on. The others (39)-(41) have a
variable object. For here (39) the mind-element occurs with respect to the five
beginning with visible data, and (40)-(41) the two mind-consciousness-elements
--
37. The meaning of the expression tathabhdva-pacciipatthana appears more clearly
where it is used again at §108. In this definition (sadhana) the function (kicca-rasa) in fact
describes the verb action (kicca) while the manifestation (paccupatthana) describes the
relevant normal state (bltava). So "tathabhava" means that what has just been taken as
a function (e.g. "receiving") is to be taken also as a state ("reception").
`460

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
occur with respect to [all] six. Here, however, body-consciousness is associated with
[bodilv] pleasure. The mind-consciousness-element (40) with two positions is
associated with [mental] joy; the other (41) is associated with equanimity
So firstly the profitable resultant without root-cause should be understood as
of eight kinds.
100. III. i. A. (a) 2. But that with root-cause is (42)-(49) that associated with
non-greed, etc., as the cause of the result. It is of eight kinds because it is classed
according to joy etc., like the profitable of the sense sphere (l)-(8). But it does not
occur with respect to the six objects38 through giving, etc., as the profitable does;
for it occurs onlv with respect to the six objects that are included among limited
states,39 as rebirth-linking, life-continuum, death, and registration. But the
prompted and unprompted states should be understood here as due to the source
it has come from, and so on.40 [456] And while there is no difference in the
associated states, the resultant should be understood as passive like the reflection
----— —r — — *——*-------------— r —-----— ~™ —
of a face in a looking-glass while the profitable is active like the face.
101.	III. i. A. (b) Unprofitable resultant, though, is without root-cause only. It is
of seven kinds as (50) eye-consciousness, (51)-(54) ear-, nose-, tongue-, and
body-consciousness, (55) mind-element with the function of receiving, and (56)
mind-consciousness-element with the function of investigating, etc., and having
five positions. It should be understood as to characteristic, etc., in the same way
as the profitable resultant without root-cause (34)-(41).
102.	Profitable resultant, though, has desirable or desirable-neutral objects
onlv, while these have undesirable or undesirable-neutral objects only. The former
are of three kinds, being classed according to equanimity, bodily pleasure, and
mental joy, while these are of two kinds, being classed according to bodily pain
and equanimity. For here it is only body-consciousness that is accompanied by
bodily pain; the rest are accompanied by equanimity. And the equanimity in
these is inferior, and not very sharp as the pain is; while in the former it is
superior, and not very sharp as the pleasure is.
So with these seven kinds of unprofitable resultant and the previous sixteen
kinds of profitable resultant, sense-sphere resultant consciousness is of twentv-
three kinds.
38.	"To the six kinds of objects all classed as limited, etc., past, etc., internal, etc"
(Vism-mht 474).
39.	Registration consciousness does not, it is stated, occur with an object of exalted
consciousness—see Vibh-a 154.
40.	"'The source it has come from, and so on means the source it has come from and its
condition. Here, in the opinion of certain teachers the result of the unprompted
profitable is unprompted and the result of the prompted is prompted, like the movement
of the face's reflection in a looking-glass when the face moves; thus it is due to the
source it has come from. But in the opinion of other teachers the unprompted arises due
to powerful kamma as condition and the prompted does so due to weak kamma; thus
it is due to its condition" (Vism-mht 474).
`461
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
103.	III. i. B. That of the fine-material sphere, however, is of five kinds (57)-(61)
like the profitable (9)-(13). But the profitable occurs in a cognitive series with the
impulsions as an attainment [of jhana], while this occurs in an existence [in the
fine-material sphere] as rebirth-linking, life-continuum, and death.
104.	III. i. C. And as that of the fine-material sphere [was like the profitable of
that sphere] so that of the immaterial sphere (62)-(65) is of four kinds like the
profitable too (14)-(17). And its occurrence is classed in the same wav as that of
the fine-material sphere.
105.	III. i. D. The supramundane resultant is of four kinds (66)-(69) because it is
[respectively] the fruitions of the consciousnesses associated with the four paths
(18)-(21). It occurs in two ways, that is to say, as [fruition in] the cognitive series
of the path and as fruition attainment (see Ch. XXII).
So resultant consciousness in all the four planes is of thirty-six kinds.
106.	III. ii. The functional, however, is of three kinds according to plane: (A) of
the sense sphere, (B) of the fine-material sphere, (C) of the immaterial sphere.
Herein, III. ii. A., that of the sense sphere, is of two kinds, namely (1) without root-
cause, and (2) with root-cause.
III. ii. A. 1. Herein, that without root-cause is that devoid of non-greed, etc., as
the cause of result. That is of two kinds, being classed as (70) mind-element, and
(71)-(72) mind-consciousness-element.
107.	Herein, (70) the mind-element has the characteristics of being the forerunner
of eye-consciousness, etc., and of cognizing visible data and so on. Its function is
to advert. It is manifested as confrontation of visible data, and so on. Its proximate
cause is the interruption of [the continued occurrence of consciousness as] life-
continuum. It is associated with equanimity only
108.	But the mind-consciousness-element is of two kinds, namely shared by all
and not shared by all. [457] Herein, (71) that shared by all is the functional [mind-
consciousness-element] accompanied by equanimity without root-cause. It has the
characteristic of cognizing the six kinds of objects. Its function is to determine at the
five doors and to advert at the mind door. It is manifested as the states [of determining
and adverting] corresponding to those [last-mentioned two functions]. Its proximate
cause is the departure either of the resultant mind-consciousness-element without
root-cause (40)-(41) [in the first case], or of one among the kinds of life-continuum
[in the second]. (72) That not shared by all is the functional [mind-consciousness-
element] accompanied by joy without root-cause. It has the characteristic of
cognizing the six kinds of objects. Its function is to cause smiling41 in Arahants
about things that are not sublime. It is manifested as the state corresponding to that
[last-mentioned function]. Its proximate cause is always the heart-basis.
So the sense-sphere functional without root-cause is of three kinds.
109. III. ii. A. 2. That, however, with root cause is of eight kinds (73)-(80), like the
profitable (l)-(8), being classed according to joy and so on. While the profitable

(Vism-mht 476). See e.g. Vin III 104.

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
arises in trainers and ordinary men only, this arises in Araliants only This is the
difference here.
So firstly that of the sense sphere is of eleven kinds.
III. ii. B., III. ii. C. That, however, of the fine-material sphere (81)-(85), and that of
the immaterial sphere (86)-(89) are [respectively] of five kinds and of four kinds
like the profitable. But thev should be understood to differ from the profitable in
that they arise only in Araliants.
So functional consciousness in the three planes is of twenty kinds in all.
110. So the 21 kinds of profitable, the 12 kinds of unprofitable, the 36 kinds of
resultant, and the 20 kinds of functional, amount in all to 89 kinds of
consciousness. And these occur in the fourteen modes of (a) rebirth-linking, (b)
life-continuum, (c) adverting, (d) seeing, (e) hearing, (f) smelling, (g) tasting, (li)
touching, (i) receiving, (j) investigating, (k) determining, (1) impulsion, (m)
registration, and (n) death.
[The 14 Modes of Occurrence of Consciousness]
111.	How so? (a) When, through the influence of the eight kinds of sense-sphere
profitable [consciousness] (l)-(8), beings come to be reborn among deities and
human beings, then the eight kinds of sense-sphere resultant with root-cause (42)-
(49) occur, and also the resultant mind-consciousness-element without root-cause
associated with equanimity (41), which is the weak profitable result with two root-
causes in those who are entering upon the state of eunuchs, etc., among human
beings—thus nine kinds of resultant consciousness in all occur as rebirth-linking;
and they do so making their object whichever among the kamma, sign of kamma, or
sign of destiny has appeared at the time of dying (see also XVII. 120).42
112.	When, through the influence of the profitable of the fine-material sphere
(9)-(13) and the immaterial sphere (14)-(17), beings are reborn [respectively] in
the fine-material and immaterial kinds of becoming, then the nine kinds of fine-
material (57)-(61) and immaterial (62)-(65) resultant occur as rebirth-linking;
and thev do so making their object only the sign of kamma that has appeared at
the time of dying.43
113. When, through the influence of the unprofitable (22)-(33), they are reborn
in a state of loss, then the one kind of unprofitable resultant mind-consciousness-
element without root-cause (56) occurs as rebirth-linking; and it does so making
its object whichever among the kamma, sign of kamma, and sign of destiny has
appeared at the time of dying. [458]
--
42.	See also M-a IV 124f. "Here 'kamma' is stored-up profitable kamma of the sense
sphere that has got an opportunity to ripen; hence he said 'that has appeared.' 'Sign of
kamma' is the gift to be given that was a condition for the volition at the moment of
accumulating the kamma. 'Sign of destiny' is the visible-data base located in the destiny
in which he is about to be reborn" (Vism-mht 477). See XVII. 136ff.
43.	"'The sign of kamma" here is onlv the kamma's own object consisting of an earth
kasina, etc" (Vism-mht 478).
`463
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
This firstly is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness
should be understood as rebirth-linking.
114.	(b) When the rebirth-linking consciousness has ceased, then, following on
whatever kind of rebirth-linking it may be, the same kinds, being the result of that
same kamma whatever it may be, occur as life-continuum consciousness with that
same object; and again those same kinds.44 And as long as there is no other kind of
arising of consciousness to interrupt the continuity, thev also go on occurring
endlessly in periods of dreamless sleep, etc., like the current of a river.45
This is how the occurrence of those same [nineteen kinds of] consciousness
should be understood as life-continuum.
115.	(c) With the life-continuum continuity occurring thus, when living beings'
faculties have become capable of apprehending an object, then, when a visible
datum has come into the eye's focus, there is impinging upon the eve-sensitivity
due to the visible datum. Thereupon, owing to the impact's influence, there
comes to be a disturbance in [the continuity of] the life-continuum.46 Then, when
the life-continuum has ceased, the functional mind-element (70) arises making that
same visible datum its object, as it were, cutting off the life-continuum and
accomplishing the function of adverting. So too in the case of the ear door and so on.
116. When an object of anyone of the six kinds has come into focus in the mind
door, then next to the disturbance of the life-continuum the functional mind-
consciousness-element without root-cause (71) arises accompanied by
44.	"'With that same object': if kamma is the life-continuum's object, then it is that
kamma; if the sign of the kamma, or the sign of the destiny then it is one of those"
(Vism-mht 478).
45.	Occurring endlessly': this is, in fact, thus called 'bliavanga' (life-continuum, lit.
'limb' (or 'practice'—see II. 11) of becoming) because of its occurring as the state of an
aiiga ('limb' or 'practice') of the rebirth-process becoming (uppatti-bhava)" (Vism-mht
478).
For the commentarial description of dream consciousness and kamma effected
during dreams, see Vibh-a (commentary to Nana-Vibhariea, Ekaka) and A-a,
(commentary to AN 5:196) which largely but not entirely overlap. Vism-mht says
here: "The seeing of dreams is done with consciousness consisting only of the
functional" (Vism-mht 478).
46. "'A disturbance in the life-continuum' is a wavering of the life-continuum
consciousness; the meaning is that there is the arrival at a state that is a reason for
dissimilarity in its occurrence twice in that way For it is called disturbance (calana)
because it is like a disturbance (movement) since there seems to be a cause for an
occasion (avatthd) in the mind's continuity different from the previous occasion.
Granted, firstly that there is impact on the sensitivity owing to confrontation with an
object, since the necessity for that is established by the existence of the objective field
and the possessor of the objective field, but how does there come to be disturbance
(movement) of the life-continuum that has a different support? Because it is connected
with it. And here the example is this: when grains of sugar are put on the surface of a
drum and one of the grains of sugar is tapped, a fly sitting on another grain of sugar
moves" (Vism-mht 478).
`464

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
equanimity, as it were, cutting off the life-continuum and accomplishing the
function of adverting.
This is how the occurrence of two kinds of functional consciousness should
be understood as adverting.
117. (d)-(h) Next to adverting,47 taking the eye door first, eye-consciousness (d)
arises accomplishing the function of seeing in the eye door and having the eve-
sensitivity as its physical basis. And [likewise] (e) ear-, (f) nose-, (g) tongue-, and
(h) body-consciousness arise, accomplishing respectively the functions of hearing,
etc., in the ear door and so on.
These comprise the profitable resultant [consciousnesses] (34)-(38) with respect
to desirable and desirable-neutral objective fields, and the unprofitable resultant
(50)-(54) with respect to undesirable and undesirable-neutral objective fields.
This is how the occurrence of ten kinds of resultant consciousness should be
understood as seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and touching.
118.	(i) Because of the words, "Eye-consciousness having arisen and ceased,
next to that there arises consciousness, mind, mentation ... which is appropriate
mind-element" (Vibh 88), etc., next to eye-consciousness, etc., and receiving the
same objective fields as they [deal with], mind-element arises as (39) profitable
resultant next to profitable resultant [eye-consciousness, etc.,] and as (55)
unprofitable resultant next to [459] unprofitable resultant [eye-consciousness,
and so on].
This is how the occurrence of two kinds of resultant consciousness should be
understood as receiving.
119.	(j) Because of the words, "Mind-element having arisen and ceased, also,
next to that there arises consciousness, mind, mentation ... which is appropriate
mind-element" (Vibh 89),48 then resultant mind-consciousness-element without
root-cause arises investigating the same objective field as that received by the
mind-element. When next to (55) unprofitable-resultant mind-element it is (56)
unprofitable-resultant, and when next to (39) profitable-resultant [mind-element]
it is either (40) accompanied by joy in the case of a desirable object, or (41)
accompanied bv equanimity in die case of a desirable-neutral object.
This is how the occurrence of three kinds of resultant consciousness should
be understood as investigating.
120. (k) Next to investigation, (71) functional mind-consciousness-element
without root-cause arises accompanied bv equanimity determining that same
objective field.
--
47.	"'Next to adverting' means next to five-door adverting. For those who do not
admit the cognitive series beginning with receiving, just as they do not admit the
heart basis, the Pali has been handed down in various places in the way beginning,
Tor the eve-consciousness element as receiving (sampaticchanaya cakklinvinnana-
dhatiiya)' (see Ch. IV n. 13); for the Pali cannot be contradicted" (Vism-mht 479). The
quotation as it stands is not traced to the Pitakas.
48.	See Ch. IV note 13.

Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
This is how the occurrence of one kind of resultant consciousness should be
understood as determining.
121. (1) Next to determining, if the visible datum, etc., as object is vivid,49 then
six or seven impulsions impel with respect to the objective fields as determined.
These are one among (l)-(8) the eight kinds of sense-sphere profitable, or (22)-
(33) the twelve kinds of unprofitable, or (72)-(80) the nine remaining sense-
sphere functional. This, firstly is the wav in the case of the five doors.
But in the case of the mind door those same [impulsions arise] next to (71)
mind-door adverting.
Beyond [the stage of] change-of-lineage50 any [of the following 26 kinds of
impulsion] that obtains a condition51 impels; that is, anv kind among (9)-(13)
the five profitable, and (81)-(85) the five functional, of the fine-material sphere,
and (14)-(17) the four profitable, and (86)-(89) the four functional of the
immaterial sphere, and also (18)-(21) the four path consciousnesses and (66)-
(69) four fruition consciousnesses of the supramundane.
This is how the occurrence of fifty-five kinds of profitable, unprofitable,
functional, and resultant consciousness should be understood as impulsion.
122. (m) At the end of the impulsions, if the object is a very vivid one52 in the five
doors, or is clear in the mind door, then in sense-sphere beings at the end of
sense-sphere impulsions resultant consciousness occurs through any condition
it mav have obtained such as previous kamma, impulsion consciousness, etc.,
with desirable, etc., object.53 [It occurs thus] as one among the eight sense-sphere
resultant kinds with root cause (42)-(49) or the three resultant mind-
consciousness elements without root-cause (40), (41), (56), and it [does so] twice
49.	"'If... vivid (lit. large)': this is said because it is the occurrence of consciousness at
the end of the impulsions that is being discussed. For an object is here intended as
'vivid' when its life is fourteen conscious moments; and that should be understood as
coming into focus when it has arisen and is two or three moments past" (Vism-mht 479).
50.	"This includes also the preliminary-work and the cleansing (see Ch. XXII, note
7), not cliange-of-lineage onlv" (Vism-mht 479). See also IV74 and XXI. 129.
51.	"'Tluit obtains a condition': any impulsion that has obtained a condition for arising next
to change-of-lineage, as that of the fine-material sphere, and so on" (Vism-mht 479).
52.	A very vivid one' is one with a life of sixteen conscious moments. For registration
consciousness arises with respect to that, not with respect to any other. 'Clear' means
very evident, and that is only in the sense sphere; for registration arises with respect
to that" (Vism-mht 479).
53.	"'Previous kamma': this is said in order to show the differences in kinds of
registration; for kamma that generates rebirth-linking is not the onlv kind to generate
registration; other kinds of kamma do so too. But the latter generates registration
unlike that generatable by the kamma that generates rebirth-linking. 'Impulsion
consciousness': this is said in order to show what defines the registration; for it is said,
'Registration is definable by impulsion' (?). The word 'etc.' includes rebirth-linking,
however; for that is not a condition for registration that is more outstanding than
itself. 'Any condition': any condition from among the desirable objects, etc., that has
combined (samaveta) to produce the arising of registration" (Vism-mht 479).

or [460] once, following after the impulsions that have impelled, and with respect
to an object other than the life-continuum's object, like some of the water that
follows a little after a boat going upstream. Though ready to occur with the life-
continuum's object after the impulsions have ended, it nevertheless occurs making
the impulsions' object its object. Because of that it is called registration
(tadarammana—lit. "having-that-as-its-object").
This is how the occurrence of eleven kinds of resultant consciousness should
be understood as registration.
123. (n) At the end of registration the life-continuum resumes its occurrence.
When the [resumed occurrence of the] life-continuum is again interrupted,
adverting, etc., occur again, and when the conditions obtain, the conscious
continuity repeats its occurrence as adverting, and next to adverting seeing, etc.,
according to the law of consciousness, again and again, until the life-continuum
of one becoming is exhausted. For the last life-continuum consciousness of all
in one becoming is called death (cuti) because of falling (cavanatta) from that
[becoming]. So that is of nineteen kinds too [like rebirth-linking and life-
continuum].
This is how the occurrence of nineteen kinds of resultant consciousness should
be understood as death.
124.	And after death there is rebirth-linking again; and after rebirth-linking,
life-continuum. Thus the conscious continuity of beings who hasten through
the kinds of becoming, destiny station [of consciousness], and abode [of beings]
occurs without break. But when a man attains Arahantship here, it ceases with
the cessation of his death consciousness.
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the consciousness
aggregate.
[The Feeling Aggregate]
125.	Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic of being felt
should be understood, all taken together, as the feeling aggregate" (§81). And
here too, what is said to have the characteristic of being felt is feeling itself,
according as it is said, Tt is felt, friend, that is why it is called feeling" (M I 293).
126. But though it is singlefold according to its individual essence as the
characteristic of being felt, it is nevertheless threefold as to kind, that is to say,
profitable, unprofitable, and indeterminate. Herein, it should be understood that
when associated with the profitable consciousness described in the way
beginning "(l)-(8) That of the sense sphere is eight-fold, being classified
according to joy equanimity knowledge, and prompting" (§83), it is profitable;54
54. "This should be regarded as a secondary characteristic (upalakkhana) of profitable
feeling, that is to say, the fact that whatever profitable feeling there is, is all associated
with profitable consciousness. That, however, is not for the purpose of establishing its
profitableness. For the profitableness of profitable feeling is not due to its association
with profitable consciousness, but rather to wise attention and so on. That is why he
said 'as to kind.' So too in the case of the unprofitable and so on" (Vism-mht 481).
`467
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
that associated with unprofitable consciousness is unprofitable; that associated
with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate. [461]
127. It is fivefold according to the analysis of its individual essence into [bodilv]
pleasure, [bodily] pain, [mental] joy, [mental] grief, and equanimity.
Herein, pleasure is associated with profitable resultant body-consciousness
(38) and pain with unprofitable resultant body-consciousness (54). Joy is
associated with 62 kinds of consciousness, namely, as to sense sphere, with 4
kinds of profitable (l)-(4), with 4 resultant with root-cause (42)-(45), with 1
resultant without root-cause (40), with 4 functional with root-cause (73)-(76),
with 1 functional without root-cause (72), and with 4 unprofitable (22)-(25);
and as to the fine-material-sphere, with 4 kinds of profitable (9)-(12), 4 resultant
(57)-(60), and 4 functional (81)-(84), leaving out that of the fifth jhana in each
case; but there is no supramundane without jhana and consequently the [eight]
kinds of supramundane (18)-(21) and (66)-(69) multiplied by the five jhana
make forty; but leaving out the eight associated with the fifth jhana, it is associated
with the remaining 32 kinds of profitable resultant. Grief is associated with two
kinds of unprofitable (30)-(31). Equanimity is associated with the remaining
fifty-five kinds of consciousness.
128. Herein, pleasure has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable tangible
datum. Its function is to intensify associated states. It is manifested as bodily
enjoyment. Its proximate cause is the body faculty
Pain has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable tangible datum. Its
function is to wither associated states. It is manifested as bodily affliction. Its
proximate cause is the body faculty
Joy has the characteristic of experiencing a desirable object. Its function is to
exploit55 in one way or another the desirable aspect. It is manifested as mental
enjoyment. Its proximate cause is tranquillity
Grief has the characteristic of experiencing an undesirable object. Its function
is to exploit in one way or another the undesirable aspect. It is manifested as
mental affliction. Its proximate cause is invariably the heart-basis.
Equanimity has the characteristic of being felt as neutral. Its function is not to
intensify or wither associated states much. It is manifested as peacefulness. Its
proximate cause is consciousness without happiness.56
55.	Sambhoga—"exploiting": not in this sense in PED (see also XVII.51).
56.	"Pleasure and pain respectively gratify and afflict by acting in one way on the
body and in another way on the mind, but not so equanimity, which is why the latter
is described as of one class.
"Just as, when a man places a piece of cotton wool on an anvil and strikes it with an
iron hammer, and his hammer goes right through the cotton and hits the anvil, the
violence of the blow is great, so too because the violence of the impact's blow is great,
body-consciousness is accompanied by pleasure when the object is a desirable or
desirable-neutral one, and by pain when the object is an undesirable or undesirable-
neutral one. [It is the impact of primary matter (tangible object) on the primaries of
the body]
`468
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the feeling
aggregate.
[The Perception Aggregate]
129. Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic of perceiving
should be understood, all taken together, as the perception aggregate" (§81).
And here too, what is said to have the characteristic of perceiving is perception
itself, according as it is said, "It perceives, friend, that is why it is called
perception" (M I 293).
But though it is singlefold according to its individual essence as the characteristic
of perceiving, it is nevertheless threefold as to kind, that is to say, profitable,
unprofitable, and indeterminate. Herein, [462] that associated with profitable
consciousness is profitable, that associated with unprofitable consciousness is
unprofitable, that associated with indeterminate consciousness is indeterminate. Since
there is no consciousness dissociated from perception, perception therefore has the
same number of divisions as consciousness [that is to say eighty-nine].
130.	But though classed in the same way as consciousness, nevertheless, as to
characteristic, etc., it all has just the characteristic of perceiving. Its function is to
make a sign as a condition for perceiving again that "this is the same," as
carpenters, etc., do in the case of timber, and so on. It is manifested as the action
of interpreting bv means of the sign as apprehended, like the blind who "see"
an elephant (Ud 68-69). Its proximate cause is an objective field in whatever wav
that appears, like the perception that arises in fawns that see scarecrows as men.
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the perception
aggregate.
[The Formations Aggregate—see Tables II & IV]
131.	Now, it was said above, "Whatever has the characteristic of forming should
be understood, all taken together, as the formations aggregate" (§81). And here
too, what is said to have the characteristic of forming is that which has the
characteristic of agglomerating.57 What is that? It is formations themselves,
according as it is said, "They form the formed, bhikkhus, that is why they are
called formations" (S III 87).
132. They have the characteristic of forming. Their function is to accumulate.
They are manifested as intervening.58 Their proximate cause is the remaining
"Herein, though profitable-resultant and unprofitable-resultant consciousness
discriminated according to the desirable and undesirable might logically be associated
with pleasure and pain, nevertheless the eight kinds of consciousness that have the eye,
etc., as their support ((34)-(37) and (50)-(53)) are invariably associated only with equanimity
because of the gentleness of the impact's blow in the case of two instances of derived
matter, like that of two pieces of cotton wool" (Vism-mht 482). For a simile see Dlis-a 263.
57. "'The characteristic of agglomerating' means the characteristic of adding together
(sampindana); then they are said to have the function of accumulating, for the dhammas
in the formations aggregate are so described because volition is their basis" (Vism-
mht 484).

Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
three [immaterial] aggregates. So according to characteristic, etc., they are
singlefold. And according to kind thev are threefold, namely (I) profitable, (II)
unprofitable, and (III) indeterminate. As regards these, when associated with
profitable consciousness they are profitable, when associated with unprofitable
consciousness they are unprofitable, when associated with indeterminate
consciousness they are indeterminate.
[According to Association with Consciousness]
133. I. (1) Herein, firstly, those associated with the first sense-sphere profitable
consciousness (1) amount to thirty-six, that is to say, the constant ones, which
are the twenty-seven given in the texts as such, and the four "or-whatever-
states,"59 and also the five inconstant ones (cf. Dhs §1).
Herein, the twenty-seven given as such are these:
(i) contact,
(ii) volition,
(iii)	applied thought, [463]
(iv)	sustained thought,
(v)	happiness (interest),
(vi)	energy,
(vii)	life,
(viii)	concentration,
(ix)	faith,
(x)	mindfulness,
(xi)	conscience,
(xii)	shame,
(xiii)	non-greed,
(xiv)	non-hate,
(xv)	non-delusion,
(xvi)	tranquillity of the [mental] body
(xvii)	tranquillity of consciousness,
(xviii)	lightness of the [mental] body
(xix)	lightness of consciousness,
(xx)	malleabilitv of the Imentall body
(xxi)	malleability of consciousness,
(xxii)	wieldiness of the [mental] body
(xxiii)	wieldiness of consciousness,
(xxiv)	proficiency of the [mental] bodv,
(xxv)	proficiency of consciousness,
(xxvi)	rectitude of the [mental) body
58.	Vipphdra—"intervening" here is explained by Vism-mht (p. 484) as vydpdra
(interest or work); not in this sense in PED. See Ch. VI, note 6.
59.	Yevdpanaka (ye-vd-pana-ka) is commentarial shorthand derived from the
Dhammasangani phrase "ye-vd-pana tasmim samaye anile pi atthi paticcasamuppannd
arupiito dhamma"—‘Ox whatever other immaterial conditionally-arisen states
(phenomena) there are too on that occasion" (Dhs 1). Cf. also M I 85.
`470
Path of Purification	Part 3: Understanding (Partita)
(xxvii) rectitude of consciousness.
The four 'or-whatever-states' are these:
(xxviii)	zeal (desire),
(xxix)	resolution,
(xxx)	attention (bringing to mind),
(xxxi)	specific neutrality.
And the five inconstant are these:
(xxxii)	compassion,
(xxxiii)	gladness,
(xxxiv)	abstinence from bodily misconduct,
(xxxv)	abstinence from verbal misconduct,
(xxxvi)	abstinence from wrong livelihood.
These last arise sometimes [but not always], and when they arise they do not
do so together.
134.	Herein, (i) it touches (phusati), thus it is contact (phassa). This has the
characteristic of touching. Its function is the act of impingement. It is manifested as
concurrence. Its proximate cause is an objective field that has come into focus.
[As to its characteristic], although this is an immaterial state, it occurs with
respect to an object as the act of touching too.60 And [as to its function], although it
is not adherent on anyone side61 as eye-cum-visible-object and ear-cum-soimd are,
yet it is what makes consciousness and the object impinge. It is said to be manifested
as concurrence because it has been described as its own action, namely, the
concurrence of the three [(cf. MI 111), that is, eye, visible object, and eye-consciousness].
And it is said to have as its proximate cause an objective field that has come into
focus because it arises automatically through the appropriate [conscious] reaction
and with a faculty when the objective field is presented. But it should be regarded as
like a hideless cow (S II 99) because it is the habitat62 of feeling.
135.	(ii) It wills (cetayati), thus it is volition (cetana); it collects, is the meaning.
Its characteristic is the state of willing. Its function is to accumulate. It is
--
60. "'As the act of touching too': by this he shows that this is its individual essence even
though it is immaterial. And the characteristic of touching is obvious in its occurrence in
such instances as, say the watering of the mouth in one who sees another tasting vinegar
or a ripe mango, the bodily shuddering in a sympathetic person who sees another being
hurt, the trembling of the knees in a timid man standing on the ground when he sees a
man precariously balanced on a high tree branch, the loss of power of the legs in one who
sees some tiling terrifying such as a pisaca (goblin)" (Vism-mht 484-85).
61.	For "non-adherent" see §46. "'On any one side' means on any one side of itself,
like a pair of planks and so on. 'Non-adherent' means not sticking (asamsilissaniana). It
is only the impact without adherence that contact shares with visible data and sound,
not the objective field. Just as, though eye and ear are non-adherent respectively to
visible data and sounds still they have the word 'touched' used of them, so too it can
be said of contact's touching and impinging on the object Contact's impinging is the
actual concurrence (meeting) of consciousness and object" (Vism-mht 485).
62.	Adhitthana—"habitat" (or site or location or foundation): this meaning not given
in PED.

Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
manifested as coordinating. It accomplishes its own and others' functions, as a
senior pupil, a head carpenter, etc., do. But it is evident when it occurs in the
marshalling (driving) of associated states in connection with urgent work,
remembering, and so on. [464]
136.	(iii)-(v) What should be said about applied thought, sustained thought, and
happiness has already been said in the commentary on the first jhana in the
Description of the Earth Kasina (IV88-98).
137.	(vi) Energy (viriya) is the state of one who is vigorous (vlra). Its characteristic
is marshalling (driving). Its function is to consolidate conascent states. It is
manifested as non-collapse. Because of the words: "Bestirred, he strives wisely"
(A II 115), its proximate cause is a sense of urgency; or its proximate cause is
grounds for the initiation of energy When rightly initiated, it should be regarded
as the root of all attainments.
138.	(vii) By its means they live, or it itself lives, or it is just mere living, thus it
is life. But its characteristic, etc., should be understood in the way stated under
material life (§59); for that is life of material things and this is life of immaterial
things. This is the onlv difference here.
139.	(viii) It puts (adhiyati) consciousness evenly (samam) on the object, or it
puts it rightly (samma) on it, or it is just the mere collecting (samadhana) of the
mind, thus it is concentration (samadhi). Its characteristic is non-wandering, or
its characteristic is non-distraction. Its function is to conglomerate conascent
states as water does bath powder. It is manifested as peace. Usually its proximate
cause is bliss. It should be regarded as steadiness of the mind, like the steadiness
of a lamp's flame when there is no draught.
140.	(ix) Bv its means they have faith (saddahanti), or it itself is the having of
faith, or it is just the act of having faith (saddahana), thus it is faith (saddha). Its
characteristic is having faith, or its characteristic is trusting. Its function is to
clarify like a water-clearing gem, or its function is to enter into, like the setting
out across a flood (cf. Sn 184). It is manifested as non-fogginess, or it is manifested
as resolution. Its proximate cause is something to have faith in, or its proximate
cause is the things beginning with hearing the Good Dhamma (saddhamma)
that constitute the factors of stream-entry.63 It should be regarded as a hand
[because it takes hold of profitable tilings], as wealth (Sn 182), and as seed (Sn 77).
141. (x) Bv its means they remember (saranti), or it itself remembers, or it is just
mere remembering (sarana), thus it is mindfulness (sati). It has the characteristic of
not wobbling.64 Its function is not to forget. It is manifested as guarding, or it is
manifested as the state of confronting an objective field. Its proximate cause is
63.	The four factors of stream-entry (see S V 347) are: waiting on good men, hearing
the Good Dliamma, wise attention, and practice in accordance with the Dliamma.
Again they are: absolute confidence in the Buddha, the Dliamma, and the Sangha, and
possession of noble virtue (S V 343).
64.	"Apilapana ('not wobbling') is the steadying of an object, the remembering and
not forgetting it, keeping it as immovable as a stone instead of letting it go bobbing
about like a pumpkin in water" (Vism-mht 487).
`472
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
strong perception, or its proximate cause is the foundations of mindfulness
concerned with the body, and so on (see MN 10). It should be regarded, however,
as like a pillar because it is firmly founded, or as like a door-keeper because it
guards the eye-door, and so on.
142. (xi)-(xii) It has conscientious scruples (hiriyati) about bodily misconduct,
etc., thus it is conscience (hiri). This is a term for modesty. It is ashamed (ottappati)
of those same things, thus it is shame (ottappa). This is a term for anxiety about
evil. Herein, conscience has the characteristic of disgust at evil, while shame has
the characteristic of dread of it. Conscience has the function of not doing evil and
that in the mode of modesty, while shame has the function of not doing it and that
in the mode of dread. They are manifested as shrinking from evil in the way
already stated. Their proximate causes are self-respect and respect of others
[respectively]. [465] A man rejects evil through conscience out of respect for himself,
as the daughter of a good family does; he rejects evil through shame out of
respect for another, as a courtesan does. But these two states should be regarded
as the guardians of the world (see A I 51).
143. (xiii)-(xv) Bv its means they are not greedy (na lubbhanti), or it itself is not
greedy or it is just the mere not being greedy (alnbbhana), thus it is non-greed
(alobha). The same method applies to non-hate (adosa) and non-delusion (amoha)
[na dussanti, adussana = adosa, and na muyhanti, amuyhana = amoha (see §§171,161)].
Of these, non-greed has the characteristic of the mind's lack of desire for an
object, or it has the characteristic of non-adherence, like a water drop on a lotus
leaf. Its function is not to lay hold, like a liberated bhikkhu. It is manifested as a
state of not treating as a shelter, like that of a man who has fallen into filth. Non-
hate has the characteristic of lack of savagery, or the characteristic of non-
opposing, like a gentle friend. Its function is to remove annoyance, or its function
is to remove fever, as sandalwood does. It is manifested as agreeableness, like the
full moon. Non-delusion has the characteristic of penetrating [things] according
to their individual essences, or it has the characteristic of sure penetration, like
the penetration of an arrow shot by a skilful archer. Its function is to illuminate
the objective field, like a lamp. It is manifested as non-bewilderment, like a guide
in a forest. The three should be regarded as the roots of all that is profitable.
144.	(xvi)-(xvii) The tranquillizing of the body is tranquillity of the body. The
tranquillizing of consciousness is tranquillity of consciousness. And here body
means the three [mental] aggregates, feeling, [perception and formations] (see
Dhs 40). But both tranquillity of that body and of consciousness have, together,
the characteristic of quieting disturbance of that body and of consciousness.
Their function is to crush disturbance of the [mental] body and of consciousness.
They are manifested as inactivity and coolness of the [mental] body and of
consciousness. Their proximate cause is the [mental] bodv and consciousness.
They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements of agitation, etc., which
cause unpeacefulness in the [mental] body and in consciousness.
145.	(xviii)-(xix) The light (quick) state of the [mental] bodv is lightness of the
body The light (quick) state of consciousness is lightness of consciousness.
They have the characteristic of quieting heaviness in the [mental] body and in
`473
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
consciousness. Their function is to crush heaviness in the [mental] body and in
consciousness. They are manifested as non-sluggishness of the [mental] body
and of consciousness. Their proximate cause is the [mental] body and
consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements of
stiffness and torpor, which cause heaviness in the [mental] body and in
consciousness.
146. (xx)-(xxi) The malleable state of the [mental] body is malleability of body.
The malleable state of consciousness is malleability of consciousness. They have
the characteristic of quieting rigidity in the [mental] body and in consciousness.
Their function is to crush stiffening in the [mental] body and in consciousness.
Thev are manifested as non-resistance. Their proximate cause is the [mental
body and consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to the defilements
of views, conceit (pride), etc., which cause stiffening of the [mental body and of
consciousness.
147.	(xxii)-(xxiii) The wieldy state of the [mental] bodv is wieldiness of body.
The wieldy state of consciousness is wieldiness of consciousness. They have the
characteristic of quieting unwieldiness in the [mental] body and in
consciousness. [466] Their function is to crush unwieldiness in the [mental]
body and in consciousness. They are manifested as success in making
[something] an object of the [mental] body and consciousness. Their proximate
cause is the [mental] body and consciousness. As bringing trust in things that
should be trusted in and as bringing susceptibility of application to beneficial
acts, like the refining of gold, they should be regarded as opposed to the remaining
hindrances, etc., that cause unwieldiness in the [mental] body and in consciousness.
148.	(xxiv)-(xxv) The proficient state of the [mental] body is proficiency of body.
The proficient state of consciousness is proficiency of consciousness. They have the
characteristic of healthiness of the [mental] body and of consciousness. Their
function is to crush unhealthiness of the [mental] bodv and of consciousness.
They are manifested as absence of disability. Their proximate cause is the [mental]
body and consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to faithlessness,
etc., which cause unhealthiness in the [mental] body and in consciousness.
149. (xxvi)-(xxvii) The straight state of the [mental] bodv is rectitude of body.
The straight state of consciousness is rectitude of consciousness. They have the
characteristic of uprightness of the [mental] body and of consciousness. Their
function is to crush tortuousness in the [mental] bodv and in consciousness.
They are manifested as non-crookedness. Their proximate cause is the [mental]
body and consciousness. They should be regarded as opposed to deceit, fraud,
etc., which cause tortuousness in the [mental] body and in consciousness.65
65. "And here by tranquilization, etc., of consciousness only consciousness is
tranquillized and becomes light, malleable, wieldy, proficient and upright. But with
tranquilization, etc., of the [mental] body also the material body is tranquillized, and
so on. This is why the twofoldness of states is given by the Blessed One here, but not
in all places" (Vism-mht 489).
`474
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
150.	(xxviii) Zeal (desire) is a term for desire to act. So that zeal has the
characteristic of desire to act. Its function is scanning for an object. It is manifested
as need for an object. That same [object] is its proximate cause. It should be
regarded as the extending of the mental hand in the apprehending of an object.
151.	(xxix) The act of resolving66 is resolution. It has the characteristic of
conviction. Its function is not to grope. It is manifested as decisiveness. Its
proximate cause is a thing to be convinced about. It should be regarded as like a
boundary-post owing to its immovableness with respect to the object.
152.	(xxx) It is the maker of what is to be made, it is the maker in the mind
(manamhi karo), thus it is attention (bringing-to-mind—rnanasi-kdra). It makes the
mind different from the previous [life-continuum] mind, thus it is attention. It
has three ways of doing this: as the controller of the object, as the controller of
the cognitive series, and as the controller of impulsions. Herein, the controller of
the object is the maker in the mind, thus it is attention. That has the characteristic
of conducting (sarana). Its function is to yoke associated states to the object. It is
manifested as confrontation with an object. Its proximate cause is an object. It
should be regarded as the conductor (sarathi) of associated states by controlling
the object, itself being included in the formations aggregate. Controller of the
cognitive series is a term for five-door adverting (70). Controller of impulsions is a
term for mind-door adverting (71). These last two are not included here.
153.	(xxxi) Specific neutrality (tatra-majjhattata—lit. "neutrality in regard
thereto") is neutrality (majjhattata) in regard to those states [of consciousness
and consciousness-concomitants arisen in association with it]. It has the
characteristic of conveying consciousness and consciousness-concomitants
evenly. Its function is to prevent deficiency and excess, [467] or its function is to
inhibit partiality. It is manifested as neutrality. It should be regarded as like a
conductor (driver) who looks with equanimity on thoroughbreds progressing
evenly.
154.	(xxxii)-(xxxiii) Compassion and gladness should be understood as given
in the Description of the Divine Abodes (IX.§92, 94, 95), except that those are of
the fine-material sphere and have attained to absorption, while these are of the
sense sphere. This is the only difference. Some, however, want to include among
the inconstant both loving-kindness and equanimity. That cannot be accepted
for, as to meaning, non-hate itself is loving-kindness, and specific neutrality is
equanimity.
155. (xxxiv)-(xxxvi) Abstinence from bodily misconduct: the compound
kayaduccaritavirati resolves as kayaduccaritato virati; so also with the other two.
But as regards characteristic, etc., these three have the characteristic of non-
transgression in the respective fields of bodily conduct, etc.; they have the
characteristic of not treading there, is what is said. Their function is to draw
back from the fields of bodily misconduct, and so on. They are manifested as the
not doing of these things. Their proximate causes are the special qualities of
66. '"The act of resolving' should be understood as the act of being convinced
(sannitthana) about an object, not as trusting (pasadana)" (Vism-mht 489). See §140.
`475
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
faith, conscience, shame, fewness of wishes, and so on. They should be regarded
as the mind's averseness from evil-doing.
156. So these are the thirty-six formations that should be understood to come
into association with the first profitable consciousness of the sense sphere (1).
And as with the first, so with the second (2), the only difference here being
promptedness.
(3)-(4) Those associated with the third (3) should be understood as all the
foregoing except non-delusion (xv). Likewise with the fourth (4), the only
difference here being promptedness.
(5)-(6) All those stated in the first instance, except happiness (v), come into
association with the fifth (5). Likewise with the sixth (6), the only difference here
being promptedness.
(7)-(8) [Those associated] with the seventh (7) should be understood as [the
last] except non-delusion (xv). Likewise with the eighth (8), the only difference
here being promptedness.
157.	(9)-(13) All those stated in the first instance, except the three abstinences
(xxxiv-xxxvi), come into association with the first of the fine-material profitable
[kinds of consciousness] (9). With the second (10) applied thought (iii) is also
lacking. With the third (11) sustained thought (iv) is also lacking. With the
fourth (12) happiness (v) is also lacking. With the fifth (13) compassion (xxxii)
and gladness (xxxiii), among the inconstant, are also lacking.
(14)-(17) In the case of the four kinds of immaterial [profitable consciousness]
these are the same as the last-mentioned, for it is onlv the immaterialness that is
the difference here.
158.	(18)-(21) As regards the supramundane, firstly, in the case of the path
consciousness having the first jhana they should be understood to be as stated
in the case of the first fine-material-sphere consciousness (9). The paths classed
as belonging to the second jhana, etc., should be understood to be as stated in
the cases [respectively] of the second fine-material-sphere jhana, and so on (10)-
(13). But the difference here is absence of compassion (xxxii) and gladness
(xxxiii),67 constancy of the abstinences (xxxiv-xxxvi), and supramundaneness.
[468]
159. II. (22) As regards the unprofitable, there are firstly seventeen associated
with the first unprofitable consciousness rooted in greed (22), that is to say,
thirteen constant given in the texts as such (see Dhs § 365) and four or-what-
ever-states.
Herein, the thirteen given as such are these:

160.	Herein, (xxxvii) it has no conscientious scruples, thus it is consciencelessness.
(xxxviii) It is unashamed, thus it is shamelessness. Of these, consciencelessness has
the characteristic of absence of disgust at bodily misconduct, etc., or it has the
characteristic of immodesty. Shamelessness has the characteristic of absence of
dread on their account, or it has the characteristic of absence of anxiety about
them. This is in brief here. The detail, however, is the opposite of what was said
above under conscience (xi) and shame (xii).
161.	(xxxix) Bv its means they are greedy or it itself is greedy or it is just the
mere being greedy thus is it greed, (xl) By its means they are deluded, or it itself
is deluded, or it is just the mere being deluded, thus it is delusion.
162.	Of these, greed has the characteristic of grasping an object, like birdlime
(lit. "monkey lime"). Its function is sticking, like meat put in a hot pan. It is
manifested as not giving up, like the dye of lamp-black. Its proximate cause is
seeing enjoyment in things that lead to bondage. Swelling with the current of
craving, it should be regarded as taking [beings] with it to states of loss, as a
swift-flowing river does to the great ocean.
163.	Delusion has the characteristic of blindness, or it has the characteristic of
unknowing. Its function is non-penetration, or its function is to conceal the
individual essence of an object. It is manifested as the absence of right theory
(see Ch. XVII, §52), or it is manifested as darkness. Its proximate cause is unwise
(unjustified) attention. It should be regarded as the root of all that is unprofitable.
164.	(xii) Bv its means they see wrongly, or it itself sees wrongly, or it is just the
mere seeing wrongly thus it is wrong view. Its characteristic [469] is unwise
(unjustified) interpreting. Its function is to presume. It is manifested as wrong
interpreting. Its proximate cause is unwillingness to see Noble Ones, and so on.
It should be regarded as the most reprehensible of all.
165.	(xiii) Agitation is agitatedness. It has the characteristic of disquiet, like
water whipped by the wind. Its function is unsteadiness, like a flag or banner
whipped by the wind. It is manifested as turmoil, like ashes flung up by pelting
`477
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
with stones. Its proximate cause is unwise attention to mental disquiet. It should
be regarded as distraction of consciousness.
166.	The remaining formations here should be understood as already stated under
the profitable. For it is only the unprofitableness that differentiates them as bad.
So these are the seventeen formations that should be understood to come into
association with the first unprofitable consciousness (22).
(23) And as with the first, so with the second (23), but here the difference is
promptedness and inconstant [occurrence] of (xliii) stiffening and torpor.
167.	Herein, (xliii) stiffening (tlnnanata) is stiffness (thlna); making torpid
(middhanata) is torpor (middha). The meaning is, paralysis due to lack of urgency
and loss of vigour. The compound thinamiddha (stiffness-and-torpor) should be
resolved into thinan ca middhari ca. Herein, stiffness has the characteristic of lack
of driving power. Its function is to remove energy. It is manifested as subsiding.
Torpor has the characteristic of unwieldiness. Its function is to smother. It is
manifested as laziness, or it is manifested as nodding and sleep.68 The proximate
cause of both is unwise attention to boredom, sloth, and so on.
168.	(24) With the third [unprofitable consciousness] (24) there should be
understood to be associated those given for the first (22), excepting wrong view
(xii). But here the difference is that there is inconstant [occurrence] of (xliv) pride
(conceit).
That [pride] has the characteristic of haughtiness. Its function is arrogance. It
is manifested as vain gloriousness. Its proximate cause is greed dissociated
from views. It should be regarded as like madness.
(25) With the fourth (25) should be understood to be associated those given
for the second (23), excepting wrong view (xii). And here pride (xliv) is among
the inconstant too.
169.	(26) Those given for the first (22), excepting happiness (v), come into
association with the fifth (26).
(27) And as with the fifth (26), so with the sixth too (27); but the difference
here is promptedness and the inconstant [occurrence] of stiffness-and-torpor
xx^x^ xu,	.IXl^C XXX^	^^xxxx^xx^j Vx ™xxxx^^	x^xj.™
(xliii).
(28) With the seventh (28) should be understood to be associated those given
for the fifth (26), except views (xii); but pride (xliv) is inconstant here. (29)
With the eighth (29) should be understood to be associated those given for the
sixth (27), except views (xii); and here too pride (xliv) is among the inconstant.
170. (30)-(31) As regards the two [kinds of unprofitable consciousness] rooted
in hate, [470] there are, firstly, eighteen associated with the first (30), that is,
eleven constant given in the texts as such (see Dhs § 413), four or-whatever-
states, and three inconstant. Herein the eleven given as such are these:
--
68. "Because the paralysis (samhanana) of consciousness comes about through
stiffness, but that of matter through torpor like that of the three aggregates beginning
with feeling, therefore torpor is manifested as nodding and sleep" (Vism-mht 493).

contact (i),

applied thought (iii),
sustained thought (iv),
energy (vi),

consciencelessness (xxxvii),
shamelessness (xxxviii),
(xiv) hate,
delusion (xl).
The four or-whatever-states are these:
zeal (xxviii),
resolution (xxix),
agitation (xiii),
attention (xxx).
The three inconstant are these:
(xlvi) envy
(xlvii) avarice,
(xlviii) worry.
171.	Herein, (xiv) by its means they hate, or it itself hates, or it is just mere
hating, thus it is hate (dosa). It has the characteristic of savageness, like a provoked
snake. Its function is to spread, like a drop of poison, or its function is to burn up
its own support, like a forest fire. It is manifested as persecuting (dusana), like an
enemy who has got his chance. Its proximate cause is the grounds for annoyance
(see A V 150). It should be regarded as like stale urine mixed with poison.
172.	(xlvi) Envying is envy. It has the characteristic of being jealous of other's
success. Its function is to be dissatisfied with that. It is manifested as averseness from
that. Its proximate cause is another's success. It should be regarded as a fetter.
173.	(xlvii) Avariciousness is avarice. Its characteristic is the hiding of one's
'	'	----o
own success that has been or can be obtained. Its function is not to bear sharing
these with others. It is manifested as shrinking, or it is manifested as meanness.
Its proximate cause is one's own success. It should be regarded as a mental
disfigurement.
174. (xlviii) The vile (kucchita) that is done (Aata) is villainy (kukata).69 The state of
that is worry (ikukkucca). It has subsequent regret as its characteristic. Its function is
to sorrow about what has and what has not been done. It is manifested as remorse.
Its proximate cause is what has and what has not been done. It should be regarded
as slavery.
--
69. Kukata is not in PED. It is impossible to render into English this "portmanteau"
etymology e.g. kucchita-kata—kukata, kukutatd ... kukkucca, which depends mostly on a
fortuitous parallelism of meaning and verbal forms in the Pali. While useless to strict
modern etymologists, it has a definite semantic and mnemonic use.

Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
175.	The rest are of the kind already described.
So these eighteen formations should be understood to come into association
with the first [unprofitable consciousness] rooted in hate (30).
(31) And as with the first (30), so with the second (31), the only difference,
however, being promptedness and the presence of stiffness and torpor (xliii)
among the inconstant.
176.	(32)-(33) As regards the two rooted in delusion, firstly: [associated] with
[the consciousness that is] associated with uncertainty (32) [471] are the eleven
given in the texts as such thus:
contact (i),
volition (ii),
applied thought (iii),
sustained thought (iv),
energy (vi),
life (vii),
(xlix) steadiness of consciousness,
consciencelessness (xxxvii),
shamelessness (xxxviii),
delusion (xl),
(1) uncertainty.
The or-whatever-states are these two:
agitation (xiii),
attention (xxx).
And these together total thirteen.
177. Herein, (xlix) steadiness of consciousness is weak concentration (viii)
consisting in mere steadiness in occurrence.70
(1) It is without wish to cure (vigata cikicchd), thus it is uncertainty (vicikicchd).
It has the characteristic of doubt. Its function is to waver. It is manifested as
indecisiveness, or it is manifested as taking various sides. Its proximate cause is
unwise attention. It should be regarded as obstructive of theory (see XVII.52).
The rest are as already described.
178. (33) [The consciousness] associated with agitation (33) has the same
[formations as the consciousness] associated with uncertainty (32), except for
uncertainty (1). But with the absence of uncertainty resolution (xxix) arises here.
So with that they are likewise thirteen, and concentration (viii) is stronger because
of the presence of resolution. Also agitation is given in the texts as such, while
resolution (xxix) and attention (xxx) are among the or-whatever-states.
--
70. "'Mere steadiness in occurrence' is mere presence for a moment. That it is only
"mere steadiness in occurrence" owing to the mere condition for the steadiness of the
mind (ceto) is because of lack of real steadiness due to absence of decidedness (uicchai/a),
and it is incapable of being a condition for such steadiness in continuity (see §188) as
the steadiness of consciousness stated thus: 'like the steadiness of a flame sheltered
from a draught' (XIV139)" (Vism-mht 495).

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
Thus should the unprofitable formations be understood.
179. III. As regards the indeterminate, firstly, the resultant indeterminate (34)-(69)
are twofold, classed as those without root-cause and those with root-cause.
Those associated with resultant consciousness without root-cause (34)-(41),
(50)-(56) are those without root-cause.
Herein, firstly, those associated with the profitable resultant (34) and
unprofitable resultant (50) eye-consciousness are the four given in the texts as
such, namely:
contact (i),
volition (ii),
life (vii),
steadiness of consciousness (xlix),
which amount to five with
attention (xxx)
as the only or-whatever-state.
These same kinds are associated with ear-, nose-, tongue-, and body-
consciousness (35)-(38), (51)-(54).
180.	Those associated with both kinds of resultant mind-element (39), (55)
come to eight by adding applied thought (iii), sustained thought (iv) and
resolution (xxix). Likewise those associated with the threefold mind-
consciousness-element with root-cause (40), (41), (56). But here (40) that
accompanied by joy should be understood to have happiness (v) also in addition
to that.
181.	The [formations] associated with resultant consciousness with root-cause
(42)-(49) are those with root-cause. Of these, firstly those associated with the
sense-sphere resultant [consciousness] with root-cause are similar to the
formations associated with the eight sense-sphere [consciousnesses] (l)-(8).
But of the inconstant ones, compassion (xxxii) and gladness (xxxiii) are not
among the resultant because they have living beings as their object. For the
resultant ones of the sense-sphere have onlv limited objects. And not only
compassion and gladness but also the three abstinences (xxxiv)-(xxxvi) are not
among the resultant; [472] for it is said that "the five training precepts are
profitable only" (Vibh 291).
182.	(57)-(69) Those associated with the resultant consciousness of the fine-
material sphere (57)-(61), the immaterial sphere (62)-(65), and the supramundane
(66)-(69) are similar to the formations associated with the profitable
consciousnesses of those kinds (9)-(21) too.
183.	(70)-(89) Functional indeterminate [formations] are also twofold classed as
those without root-cause (70)-(72) and those with root-cause (73)-(80). Those
without root-cause are associated with functional consciousness without root-
cause; and they are the same as those associated [respectively] with profitable
resultant mind-element (39) and the pair of mind-consciousness-elements
without root-cause (40)-(41). But in the case of the two mind-consciousness-
`481
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
elements (71)-(72), energy (vi) is additional, and because of the presence of
energy concentration (viii) is strong. This is the difference here.
184. Those associated with functional consciousness with root-cause (73)-
(80) are those with root-cause. Of these, firstly those associated with the eight
sense-sphere functional consciousnesses (73)-(80) are similar to the formations
associated with the eight sense-sphere profitable (l)-(8), except for the
abstinences (xxxiv)-(xxxvi).
Those associated with the functional [consciousnesses] of the fine-material
sphere (81)-(85) and the immaterial sphere (86)-(89) are in all aspects similar to
those associated with profitable consciousness (9)-(17).
This is how formations should be understood as indeterminate.
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the formations
aggregate.
[C. Classification of the Aggregates]
185.	The foregoing section, firstly, is that of the detailed explanation of the
aggregates according to the Abhidhamma-Bhajaniya [of the Vibhahga]. But the
aggregates have been given in detail by the Blessed One [in the Suttanta-
Bhajaniya] in this way: "Any materiality whatever, whether past, future or present,
internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: all that
together in the mass and in the gross is called the materiality aggregate. Anv
feeling whatever ... Any perception whatever ... Any formations whatever ...
Any consciousness whatever, whether past, future or present ... all that together
in the mass and in the gross is called the consciousness aggregate" (Vibh 1-9;
cf. M III 17).
[Materiality]
186.	Herein, the word whatever includes without exception. Materiality prevents
over-generalization. Thus materiality is comprised without exception by the two
expressions. Then he undertakes its exposition as yastr future and present, etc.;
for some of it is classed as past and some as future, and so on. So also in the case
of feeling, and so on.
Herein, the materiality called (i) past is fourfold, according to (a) extent, (b)
continuity (c) period, and (d) moment. Likewise (ii) the future and (iii) the present.71
--
71. "Here when the time is delimited by death and rebirth-linking the term 'extent'
is applicable. It is made known through the Suttas in the way beginning 'Was I in the
past?' (MI 8); for the past state is likewise mentioned as 'extent' in the Bhaddekaratta
Sutta too in the way beginning, 'He does not follow what is past (the past extent)' (M
III 1 88). But when it is delimited in the ultimate sense as in the Addhaniruttipatha
Sutta thus, 'Bhikkhus, there are three extents, the past extent, the future extent, and
the present extent' (It 53), then it is appropriate as delimited by moment. Herein, the
existingness of the present is stated thus, 'Bhikkhus, of matter that is born... manifested,
it is said that: "It exists'" (SIV 72), and pastness and futureness are respectively called
before and after that" (Vism-mht 496).
`482
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
187.	Herein, (a) firstly, according to extent: in the case of a single becoming of
one [living being], previous to rebirth-linking is past, subsequent to death is
future, between these two is present.
188.	(b) According to continuity: that [materiality] which has like or single
origination72 by temperature and single origination by nutriment, though it
occurs successively, [473] is present. That which, previous to that, was of unlike
origination bv temperature and nutriment is past. That which is subsequent is
future. That which is born of consciousness and has its origination in one
cognitive series, in one impulsion, in one attainment, is present. Previous to that
is past. Subsequent to that is future. There is no special classification into past
continuity etc., of that which has its origination in kamma, but its pastness, etc.,
should be understood according as it supports those which have their origination
through temperature, nutriment, and consciousness.
189.	(c) According to period: any period among those such as one minute,
morning, evening, day-and-night, etc., that occurs as a continuity is called present.
Previous to that is past. Subsequent is future.
190.	(d) According to moment: what is included in the trio of moments, [that is to
say arising, presence, and dissolution] beginning with arising is called present.
At a time previous to that it is future. At a time subsequent to that it is past.73
191.	Furthermore, that whose functions of cause and condition74 have elapsed
is past. That whose function of cause is finished and whose function of condition
72.	"Cold temperature is like with cold, and hot with hot. But that temperature which
falls on the body, whether hot or cold, and occurs as a continuity in one mode, being
neither less nor more, is called 'single temperature.' The word 'single' is used because
of the plurality of Tike' temperature. So too with nutriment. 'In one cognitive series,, in
one impulsion' refers respectively to five-door and mind-door consciousness. The
explanations of continuity and period are given in the Commentaries for the purpose
of helping the practice of insight" (Vism-mht 496).
73.	In these two paragraphs "past" and "future" refer not to time, as in the other
paragraphs, but to the materiality.
74.	"'Cause' (hetu) is what gives birth (janaka); 'condition' (vaccaya) is what consolidates
V^	T	Z7 '
(upattliamblwka). Their respective fimctions are arousing and consolidating. Just as the
seed's function is to arouse the sprout and that of the earth, etc., is to consolidate it,
and just as kamma's function is to arouse result as matter that is due to kamma
performed, and that of nutriment is to consolidate it, so the function of those [conditions]
that give birth to each material group and each thought-arising and serve as kamma
and proximity-conditions, etc., for them, and the function of those that consolidate
them and serve as conascence, prenascence, and postnascence conditions for them
may be construed accordingly as appropriate.
"Because there is similarity and dissimilarity in temperature, etc., in the way stated,
the pastness, etc., of material instances originated by it are stated according to
continuity But there is no such similarity and dissimilarity in the kamma that gives
birth to a single becoming, so instead of stating according to continuity the pastness,
etc., of material instances originated by that, it is stated according to what consolidates.
However, when there comes to be reversal of sex, then the male sex disappears owing

is unfinished is present. That which has not attained to either function is future.
Or alternatively the moment of the function is present. At a time previous to that
it is future. At a time subsequent to that it is past.
And here onlv the explanations beginning with the moment are absolutely
literal. The rest are in a figurative [or relative] sense.
192.	(iv)-(v) The division into internal and external is as already stated (§73).
Besides, it is internal in the sense of one's own75 that should be understood here
as internal and that of another person as external.
(vi)-(vii) Gross and subtle_axe also as already stated (§73).
193.	(viii)-(ix) Inferior and superior are twofold, namely, figuratively
(relatively) and absolutely (literallv). Herein, the materiality of the Sudassin
deities is inferior to the materiality of the Akanittha (Highest) deities. That
same materiality [of the Sudassin deities] is superior to the materiality of the
Sudassa deities. Thus, firstly, should inferiority and superiority be understood
figuratively (relatively) down as far as the denizens of hell. But absolutely
(literally) it is inferior where it arises as unprofitable result, and it is superior
where it arises as profitable result.76
194.	(x)-(xi) Far and near: this is also as already described (§73). Besides, relative
farness and nearness should be understood here according to location.
195.	All that together in the mass and in the gross: bv making all that materiality
separately described by the words "past," etc., into a collection by understanding
its oneness, in other words, its characteristic of being molested (ruppana), it
comes to be called the materiality (rupa) aggregate. This is the meaning here.
196.	By this, too, it is shown that the materiality aggregate is all materiality
which all comes into the collection with the characteristic of being molested; for
there is no materiality aggregate apart from materiality. [474]
And just as in the case of materiality so also feeling, etc., [are respectively
shown as the feeling aggregate, etc.,] since they come under the collections with
the [respective] characteristics of being felt, etc.; for there is no feeling aggregate
apart from feeling and so on.

to powerful unprofitable kamma, and the female sex appears owing to weak profitable
kamma; and the female sex disappears owing to weak unprofitable kamma, while the
male sex appears owing to powerful profitable kamma (see Dhs-a 321). So there is in
fact dissimilarity in what is originated by kamma and consequent dissimilarity in
what is past, etc., in accordance with the continuity of these as well. But it is not
included because it does not happen always" (Vism-mht 497).
75.	Niyakajjliatta—"internally in the sense of one's own": four kinds of ajjliatta (internal,
lit. "belonging to oneself") are mentioned in the commentaries and sub-commentaries
(see Dhs-a 46): gocarajjlwtta—internally as range or resort (M-a IV 161; II 90, 292),
ajjhattajjhata—internally as such (Vism-mht 152), niyakajjliatta—internally in the sense
of one's own (IV141, IX. 114, this ref.; M-a IV 161), visayajjliatta—internally as objective
field (M-a IV 160).
76.	Profitable result is superior because it produces a desirable object (see Vism-
mht 498). This question is treated at length at Viblva 9f.
`484

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
[Feeling]
197.	In the classification (i)-(iii) into past, etc., the past, future, and present
state of feeling should be understood according to continuity and according to
moment and so on.
Herein, according to continuity, that included in a single cognitive series, a
single impulsion, a single attainment, and that occurring in association with an
objective field of one kind,77 is present. Before that is past. Subsequent is future.
According to moment, etc.: that feeling included in the trio of moments, which is
in between the past time and the future time, and which is performing its own
function, is present. Before that is past. Subsequent is future.
198.	(iv)-(v)The classification into internal and external should be understood
according to the internal in the sense of one's own.
(vi)-(vii) The classification into gross and subtle should be understood (a)
according to kind, (b) individual essence, (c) person, and (d) the mundane
and supramundane, as stated in the Vibhanga in the way beginning
"Unprofitable feeling is gross, profitable and indeterminate feeling is subtle,
[profitable and unprofitable feeling is gross, indeterminate feeling is subtle]"
(Vibh 3), and so on.
199. (a) According to kind, firstly: unprofitable feeling is a state of disquiet,
because it is the cause of reprehensible actions and because it produces
burning of defilement, so it is gross [compared] with profitable feeling. And
because it is accompanied by interestedness and drive and result, and because
of the burning of the defilements, and because it is reprehensible, it is gross
compared with resultant indeterminate. Also because it is accompanied by
result, because of the burning of the defilements, and because it is attended
by affliction and is reprehensible, it is gross compared with functional
indeterminate. But in the opposite sense profitable and indeterminate feeling
are subtle compared with unprofitable feeling. Also the two, that is, profitable
and unprofitable feeling, involve interestedness, drive and result, so they are
respectively gross compared with the twofold indeterminate. And in the
opposite sense the twofold indeterminate is subtle compared with them. This,
firstly, is how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to
kind.
200. (b) According to individual essence: painful feeling is gross compared with
the others because it is without enjoyment, it involves intervention, causes
disturbance, creates anxiety, and is overpowering. The other two are subtle
compared with the painful because they are satisfying, peaceful, and superior,
and respectively agreeable and neutral. Both the pleasant and the painful are
gross compared with the neither-painful-nor-pleasant because they involve
intervention, cause disturbance and are obvious. The latter is subtle in the way
--
77. "The feeling that accompanies the faith, etc., occurring in one who sees an image
of the Buddha or who hears the Dhamma, even for a whole day, is 'present'" (Vism-
mht 499).
`485
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
aforesaid compared with both the former. Thus should grossness and subtlety
be understood according to individual essence.
201.	(c) According to person: feeling in one who has no attainment is gross
compared with that in one who has one, because it is distracted bv a multiple
object. In the opposite sense the other is subtle. This is how grossness and
subtlety should be understood according to person. [475]
202.	(d) According to the mundane and supramundane: feeling subject to
cankers is mundane, and that is gross compared with that free from
cankers, because it is the cause for the arising of cankers, is liable to the
floods, liable to the bonds, liable to the ties, liable to the hindrances, liable
to the clingings, defilable, and shared by ordinary men. The latter, in the
opposite sense, is subtle compared with that subject to cankers. This is
how grossness and subtlety should be understood according to the
mundane and supramundane.
203.	Herein, one should beware of mixing up [the classifications] according to
kind and so on. For although feeling associated with unprofitable resultant
body-consciousness is subtle according to kind because it is indeterminate, it is
nevertheless gross according to individual essence, and so on. And this is said:
"Indeterminate feeling is subtle, painful feeling is gross. The feeling in one with
an attainment is subtle, that in one with no attainment is gross. Feeling free from
cankers is subtle, feeling accompanied by cankers is gross" (Vibh 3). And like
painful feeling, so also pleasant, etc., is gross according to kind and subtle
according to individual essence.
204.	Therefore feeling's grossness and subtlety should be understood in such
a way that there is no mixing up of the classifications according to kind and so
on. For instance, [when it is said] "The indeterminate according to kind is subtle
compared with the profitable and the unprofitable," the individual-essence class,
etc., must not be insisted upon like this: "Which kind of indeterminate? Is it the
painful? Is it the pleasant? Is it that in one with an attainment? Is it that in one
with no attainment? Is it that subject to cankers? Is it that free from cankers?"
and so in each instance.
205. Furthermore, because of the words "Or feeling should be regarded as
gross or subtle in comparison with this or that feeling" (Vibh 4), among the
unprofitable, etc., feeling accompanied by hate, too, is gross compared with that
accompanied by greed because it burns up its own support, like a fire; and that
accompanied by greed is subtle. Also, that accompanied by hate is gross when
the hate is constant, and subtle when it is inconstant. And the constant is gross
when giving result that lasts for the aeon, while the other is subtle. And of those
giving result lasting for the aeon the unprompted is gross, while the other is
subtle. But that accompanied by greed is gross when associated with [false]
view, while the other is subtle. That also when constant and giving result lasting
for the aeon and unprompted is gross, while the others are subtle. And without
distinction the unprofitable with much result is gross, while that with little
result is subtle. But the profitable with little result is gross, while that with much
result is subtle.

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
206. Furthermore, the profitable of the sense sphere is gross; that of the fine-
material sphere is subtle; next to which the immaterial, and next the
supramundane [should be similarly compared]. That of the sense sphere is
gross in giving, while it is subtle in virtue; next, that in development. Also, that
in development is gross with two root-causes, while with three root-causes it is
subtle. Also that with three root-causes is gross when prompted, while it is
subtle when unprompted. That of the fine-material sphere is gross in the first
jhana, [while it is subtle in the second jhana. That also of the second jhana is
gross] ... of the fifth jhana is subtle. And that of the immaterial sphere associated
with the base consisting of boundless space is gross ... [476] that associated
with the base consisting of neither-perception-nor-non-perception is subtle only.
And the supramundane associated with the stream-entry path is gross ... that
associated with the Arahant path is subtle only The same method applies also
to resultant and functional feeling in the various planes and to feeling stated
according to pain, etc., according to one with no attainment, etc., and according
to that subject to cankers, and so on.
207.	Then according to location, painful feelings in hell are gross, while in the
animal generation they are subtle ... Those among the Paranimmitavasavatti
Deities are subtle only And the pleasant should be construed throughout like
the painful where suitable.
208.	And according to physical basis, any feeling that has an inferior physical
basis is gross, while one with a superior physical basis is subtle.
(viii)-(ix) What is gross should be regarded as inferior in the inferior-superior
classification, and what is subtle superior.
209.	[(x)-(xi) The word far is explained in the Vibhanga in the way beginning
"The unprofitable is far from the profitable and indeterminate" (Vibh 4) and the
word near in the way beginning "Unprofitable feeling is near to unprofitable
feeling" (Vibh 4). Therefore, unprofitable feeling is far from the profitable and
the indeterminate because of dissimilarity, unconnectedness, and non-
resemblance. The profitable and the indeterminate are likewise far from the
unprofitable. And so in all instances. But unprofitable feeling is near to
unprofitable feeling because of similarity and resemblance.
This is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the past, etc.,
classifications of the feeling aggregate.
[Perception, Formations and Consciousness]
210. This should also be understood of the perception, etc., associated with
any kind of feeling.
[D. Classes of Knowledge of the Aggregates]
Having understood this, again as regards these same aggregates:
Knowledge of aggregates is classed
(1) As to order, and (2) distinction,
(3)	As to neither less nor more,
(4)	And likewise as to simile,
`487
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
(5)	And twice as to how to be seen,
(6)	And as to good for one seeing thus—
This is the way of exposition
That a wise man should rightly know.
211. 1. Herein, as to order: order is of several kinds, namely order of arising,
order of abandoning, order of practice, order of plane, order of teaching.
Herein, "First there comes to be the foetus in the first stage, then there comes
to be the foetus in the second stage" (S I 206), etc., is order of arising. "Things to
be abandoned by seeing, things to be abandoned by development" (Dhs 1), etc.,
is order of abandoning. "Purification of virtue [477] ... purification of
consciousness" (M I 148), etc., is order of practice. "The sense sphere, the fine-
material sphere" (Patis I 83), etc., is order of plane. "The four foundations of
mindfulness, the four right efforts" (D II 120), etc., or "Talk on giving, talk on
virtue" (M I 379), etc., is order of teaching.
212.	Of these, firstly, order of arising is not applicable here because the aggregates
do not arise in the order in which they are successively dealt with, as is the case
with "the foetus in the first stage," etc., nor is order of abandoning applicable,
because the profitable and indeterminate are not to be abandoned; nor is order of
practice, because what is unprofitable is not to be practiced; nor is order of plane,
because feeling, etc., are included in all four planes.
213.	Order of teaching is appropriate however; for there are those people who,
while teachable, have fallen into assuming a self among the five aggregates
owing to failure to analyze them; and the Blessed One is desirous of releasing
them from the assumption by getting them to see how the [seeming] compactness
of mass [in the five aggregates] is resolved; and being desirous of their welfare,
he first, for the purpose of their easy apprehension, taught the materiality
aggregate, which is gross, being the objective field of the eye, etc.; and after that,
feeling, which feels matter as desirable and undesirable; then perception, which
apprehends the aspects of feeling's objective field, since "What one feels, that
one perceives" (M I 293); then formations, which form volitionally through the
means of perception; and lastly consciousness, which these things beginning
with feeling have as their support, and which dominates them.78
This, in the first place, is how the exposition should be known as to order.
214. 2. As to distinction: as to the distinction between aggregates and aggregates-
as-objects-of-clinging. But what is the distinction between them? Firstly, aggregates is
said without distinguishing. Aggregates [as objects] of clinging is said distinguishing
those that are subject to cankers and are liable to the clingings, according as it is
said: "Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the five aggregates and the five aggregates [as
objects] of clinging. Listen ... And what, bhikkhus, are the five aggregates? Any
kind of materiality whatever, bhikkhus, whether past, future or present ... far or
--
78. "Consciousness dominates because of the words, 'Dhammas have mind as their
forerunner' (Dhp 1), 'Dhammas (states) that have parallel turn-over with consciousness'
(Dhs §1522), and 'The king, lord of the six doors (?)'" (Vism-mht 503).
`488
Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
near: this is called the materiality aggregate. Any kind of feeling whatever ... Any
kind of perception whatever ... Anv kind of formations whatever ... Any kind of
consciousness whatever ... far or near: this is called the consciousness aggregate.
These, bhikkhus, are called the five aggregates. And what, bhikkhus, are the five
aggregates [as objects] of clinging? Anv kind of materiality whatever ... far or near,
that is subject to cankers and liable to the clingings: this is called the materiality
aggregate [as object] of clinging. Any kind of feeling whatever ... Any kind of
perception whatever ... Any kind of formations whatever ... Any kind of
consciousness whatever ... far or near, that is subject to cankers and liable to the
clingings: this is called the consciousness aggregate [as object] of clinging. These,
bhikkhus, are called the five aggregates [as objects] of clinging" (S III 47). [478]
215. Now, while there is feeling, etc., both free from cankers [and subject to
them],79 not so materiality. However, since materiality can be described as a
[simple] aggregate in the sense of a total, it is therefore mentioned among the
[simple] aggregates. And since it can be described as an aggregate [that is the
object] of clinging in the sense of a total and in the sense of being subjected to
cankers, that [same materiality] is therefore mentioned among the aggregates
[as objects] of clinging too. But feeling, etc., are only mentioned among the
[simple] aggregates when they are free from cankers. When they are subject to
cankers, they are mentioned among the aggregates [as objects] of clinging. And
here the meaning of the term "aggregates as objects of clinging" should be
regarded as this: aggregates that are the resort of clinging are aggregates of
clinging. But here all these taken together are intended as aggregates.
216.	3. As to neither less nor more: but why are five aggregates, neither less nor
more, mentioned by the Blessed One? (a) Because all formed things that resemble
each other fall into these groups, (b) because that is the widest limit as the basis
for the assumption of self and what pertains to self, and (c) because of the
inclusion80 by them of the other sorts of aggregates.
217.	(a) When the numerous categories of formed states are grouped together
according to similarity81 materiality forms one aggregate through being grouped
--
79.	Sammoliavinodam (Be) (Khandha Vibhariga Commentary) in the identical passage,
reads vedanadayo anasava pi sasavd pi atthi. Ee and Ae read vedanadayo anasava pi at tin.
80.	Avarodha—"inclusion": not in PED. The term etaparama—"the widest limit" is not
mentioned in PED See MI 80, 339; S V 119; M-a III, 281. Cf. also etavapararna, M1246.
81.	"When all formed dhammas are grouped together according to similarity they
naturally fall into five aggregates. Herein, it is the items that are the same owing to the
sameness consisting respectively in 'molesting,' etc., that are to be understood as
'similar/ Among them, those that are strong in the volition whose nature is accumulating
with the function of forming the formed, are called the formations aggregate. And the
others, that is, contact, etc., which are devoid of the distinguishing characteristics of
'being molested,' etc., may also be so regarded under the generality of forming the
formed. But the similarities consisting in touching are not describable separately by
the word 'aggregate,' and so that is why no aggregates of contact, etc., have been
stated by the Perfect One who knows the similarities of dhammas. 'Bhikkhus, whatever
ascetics or brahmans there are who are asserters of eternity and declare the self and
`489
Chapter XIV
The Aggregates
together according to similarity consisting in materiality; feeling forms one
aggregate through being grouped together according to similarity consisting
in feeling; and so with perception and the other two. So they are stated as five
because similar formed things fall into groups.
218.	(b) And this is the extreme limit as the basis for the assumption of self and
what pertains to self, that is to say, the five beginning with materiality. For this is
said: "Bhikkhus, when matter exists, it is through clinging to matter, through
insisting upon (interpreting) matter, that such a view as this arises: 'This is
mine, this is I, this is my self.' When feeling exists ... When perception exists ...
When formations exist ... When consciousness exists, it is through clinging to
consciousness, through insisting upon (interpreting) consciousness, that such
a view as this arises: 'This is mine, this is I, this is my self'"(S III 181-82). So they
are stated as five because this is the widest limit as a basis for the assumption of
self and what pertains to self.
219.	(c) And also, since those other [sorts of aggregates] stated as the five
aggregates of things beginning with virtue82 are comprised within the formations
aggregate, they are included here too. Therefore they are stated as five because
they include the other sorts.
This is how the exposition should be known as to neither less nor more.
220. 4. As to simile: the materiality aggregate [as object] of clinging is like a
sick-room because it is the dwelling-place, as physical basis, door, and object, of
the sick man, namely the consciousness aggregate as object of clinging. The
feeling aggregate as object of clinging is like the sickness because it afflicts. The
perception aggregate as object of clinging is like the provocation of the sickness
because it gives rise to feeling associated with greed, etc., owing to perception of
sense desires, and so on. The formations aggregate as object of clinging is like
having recourse to what is unsuitable because it is the source of feeling, which
is the sickness; [479] for it is said: "Feeling as feeling is the formed that they
form" (S III 87), and likewise: "Because of unprofitable kamma having been
performed and stored up, resultant body-consciousness has arisen accompanied
by pain" (Dhs §556). The consciousness aggregate as object of clinging is like
the sick man because it is never free from feeling, which is the sickness.
221. Also thev are (respectively) like the prison, the punishment, the offence,
the punisher, and the offender. And they are like the dish, the food, the curry
sauce [poured over the food], the server, and the eater.83
--
the world to be eternal, all do so depending and relying on these same five aggregates
or on one or other of them' (cf. S IV 46), and so on" (Vism-mht 503).
82.	The aggregates of virtue, concentration, understanding, liberation, and knowledge
and vision of liberation (S I 99), etc.
83.	"The matter of the body is like the prison because it is the site of the punishment.
Perception is like the offence because owing to perception of beauty etc., it is a cause of
the punishment, which is feeling. The formations aggregate is like the punisher because it
is a cause of feeling. Consciousness is like the offender because it is afflicted by feeling.
Again, matter is like the dish because it bears the food. Perception is like the curry sauce

Path of Purification
Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
This is how the exposition should be known as to simile.
222.	5. Twice as to how to he seen: the exposition should be known twice as to
how to be seen, namely in brief and in detail.
223.	In brief [that is, collectively] the five aggregates as objects of clinging
should be seen as an enemy with drawn sword (S IV 174) in the Snake Simile, as
a burden (S III 25) according to the Burden Sutta, as a devourer (S III 87f)
according to the To-be-devoured Discourse, and as impermanent, painful, not-
self, formed, and murderous, according to the Yamaka Sutta (S III 112f).
224.	In detail [that is, individually,] matter should be regarded as a lump of
froth because it will not stand squeezing, feeling as a bubble on water because it
can only be enjoyed for an instant, perception as a mirage because it causes
illusion, formations as a plantain trunk because they have no core, and
consciousness as a conjuring trick because it deceives (S III 140-42).
In particular, even sublime internal materiality84 should be regarded as foul
(ugly); feeling should be regarded as painful because it is never free from the
three kinds of suffering (see XVI.34); perception and formations as not-self
because they are unmanageable; and consciousness as impermanent because it
has the nature of rise and fall.
225.	6. As to good for one seeing thus: good comes to be accomplished in one who
sees in the two ways thus in brief and in detail. And the way of definition should
be known according to that, that is to say firstly one who sees the five aggregates
as objects of clinging in the form of an enemy with drawn sword, etc., is not
worried by the aggregates, but one who sees materiality etc., in detail as a lump
of froth, etc., is not one who sees a core in the coreless.
226.	And in particular, [480] one who sees internal materiality as foul (ugly)
fully understands nutriment consisting of physical nutriment. He abandons
the perversion [of perceiving] beauty in the foul (ugly), he crosses the flood of
sense desire, he is loosed from the bond of sense desire, he becomes canker-free
as regards the canker of sense desire, he breaks the bodily tie of covetousness. He
does not cling with sense-desire clinging.
227.	One who sees feeling as pain fully understands nutriment consisting of
contact. He abandons the perversion of perceiving pleasure in the painful. He
crosses the flood of becoming. He is loosed from the bond of becoming. He
becomes canker-free as regards the canker of becoming. He breaks the bodily tie
of ill will. He does not cling with rules-and-vows clinging.
228. One who sees perception and formations as not-self fully understands
nutriment consisting of mental volition. He abandons the perversion of
--
because, owing to perception of beauty etc., it hides the food, which is feeling. The
formations aggregate is like the server because it is a cause of feeling; and service is
included since one who is taking a meal is usually served. Consciousness is like the
eater because it is helped by feeling" (Vism-mht 504). For cdraka (prison) see XVI.18.
84. Ee and Ae both read visesato ca suldram pi ajjliattikam riiparn. But SammohavinodanJ
(Be) in identical passage reads visesato ca subharammanam pi oldrikam pi ajjhattika-riipam.

perceiving self in the not-self. He crosses the flood of views. He is loosed from
the bond of views. He breaks the bodily tie of interpretations (insistence) that
'This is the truth." He does not cling with self-theory clinging.
229.	One who sees consciousness as impermanent fully understands nutriment
consisting of consciousness. He abandons the perversion of perceiving
permanence in the impermanent. He crosses the flood of ignorance. He is loosed
from the bond of ignorance. He becomes canker-free as regards the canker of
ignorance. He breaks the bodily tie of holding to rules and vows. He does not
[cling with false-] view clinging.

Therefore the wise should see

The Bases and Elements
(Ayatana-dhatu-niddesa)
[A. Description of the Bases]
1.	[481] The "bases" (XIV32) are the twelve bases, that is to say, the eye base,
visible-data base, ear base, sound base, nose base, odour base, tongue base, flavour
base, body base, tangible-data base, mind base, mental-data base.
2.	Herein:
(1) Meaning, (2) character, (3) just so much,
(4) Order, and (5) in brief and detail,
(6) Likewise as to how to be seen—
Thus should be known the exposition.
3. 1. Herein, [as to meaning] firstly individually:
It relishes (cakkhati), thus it is an eye (cakkhu); the meaning is that it enjoys a
visible datum and turns it to account.
It makes visible (riipayati), thus it is a visible datum (rupa); the meaning is that
by undergoing an alteration in appearance (colour) it evidences what state is in
the mind (lit. heart).
It hears (sunati), thus it is an ear (sota).
It is emitted (sappati), thus it is sound (sadda); the meaning is that it is uttered.
It smells (ghayati), thus it is a nose (ghdna).
It is smelt (gandhayati) thus it is odour (gandha); the meaning is that it betrays
its own physical basis.
It evokes (avhayati) life (jwita), thus it is a tongue (jivha).
Living beings taste (rasanti) it, thus it is flavour (rasa); the meaning is that they
enjoy it.
It is the origin (aya) of vile (kucchita) states subject to cankers, thus it is a body
It is smelt (gandhayati) thus it is odour (gandha); the meaning is that it betrays
its own physical basis.
It evokes (avhayati) life (jivita), thus it is a tongue (jivha).
Living beings taste (rasanti) it, thus it is flavour (rasa); the meaning is that they
enjoy it.
It is the origin (aya) of vile (kucchita) states subject to cankers, thus it is a body
(kdya), origin being the place of arising.
It is touched (phusiyati), thus it is a tangible datum (photthabba).
It measures (munati), thus it is a mind (mano).
They cause their own characteristic to be borne (dharayanti), thus they are
mental data (dhamma).1
`493
Chapter XV
The Bases and Elements
4. [As to meaning] in general, however, base (dyatana) should be understood
as such (a) because of its actuating (ayatana), (b) because of being the range
(tanana) of the origins (aya), and (c) because of leading on (nayana) what is actuated
(dyata).2
Now, the various states of consciousness and its concomitants belonging to
such and such a door-cum-object among those consisting of the eye-cum-visible-
datum, etc., (a) are actuated (dyatanti), each bv means of its individual function
of experiencing, etc.; they are active, strive, and endeavour in these, is what is
meant. And (b) these [doors-cum-objects] provide the range for (tananti) those
states that are origins (aya); they give them scope, is what is meant. And (c) as
long as this suffering of the round of rebirths, which has gone on occurring
throughout the beginningless round of rebirths and so is enormously actuated
(dyata), does not recede, so long they lead on (nayanti); they cause occurrence, is
what is meant.
So all these [482] things are called "bases" because they actuate, because they
are the range of the origins, and because they lead on what is actuated.
--
1. The following words in §3 are not in PED: cakkliati (it relishes), rupayati (it makes
visible—only referred to under rupa), sappati (it is emitted; pass, of sapati, to swear
(Ud 45)), udahariyati (it is uttered, lit. "is carried up to"),gandliayati (it is smelt), sucayati
(it betrays), rasati (it tastes). Be ed. of Vibh-a reads manayati (not in PED) for munati in
parallel passage.
Vism-mht (p. 508) explains cakkliati (relishes) semantically by "tasting a flavour as
in 'relishing' honey or sauce" and cites M I 503. Linguistically it connects the word
with acikkliati (to show).
"When a visible form (rupa) undergoes, like the visible aspect of a chameleon, an
alteration in appearance (colour) at times when [the mind is] dyed with greed or
corrupted with hate, etc., it makes visible what state [is prevalent] in the heart (i.e. the
mind) and makes that evident as though it were an actual visible object; the meaning
is that it demonstrates it by giving it, as it were, a graspable entity (saviggaha). Or the
word rupa means demonstration, and that is the same as evidencing. Or the word
rupa can be regarded as evidencing of elements too, since it has many meanings.
Rupayati (it makes visible) is a derivative (nibbacana) of the word rupa that expresses
appearance (colour), while ruppati (it is molested) is a derivative that expresses the
materiality aggregate. [As to sound] only the sound of words (vacaua-sadda) would be
covered by the meaning 'is uttered (udahariyati)/ and here sound is not only the sound
of words, but rather all that can be cognized by the ear is what 'is emitted (sappati)'; the
meaning is that by means of its own conditions it is emitted (sappiyati), is made
cognizable by the ear" (Vism-mht 508) (cf. also sappari, to crawl). "Tt evokes life (jwitarn
avhayati)' owing to appetite for tastes in food (ahara), which is the cause of life (jivita),
since the act of swallowing is rooted in approval of tastes. This is the linguistic
characteristic of the word jivhd (tongue)" (Vism-mht 509).
2. The following words in §4 are not in PED: ayatana (actuating: verbal n. fm. ayatati,
to actuate); tanana (range: verbal n. fm. tauoti, to provide a range for, to extend—q.v.
PED—; mentioned under ayatana, base); nayana (lead in on: verbal n. fm. neti, to lead
on; lit, meaning not in PED); ayatati (to actuate—cakkhuvinnanadmam uppadanam
dyatanam, Vism-mht). See also ayapenti Patis II 21.
`494

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
5.	Furthermore, "base, (ayatana) should be understood in the sense of place of
abode, store (mine),3 meeting place, locality of birth, and cause. For accordingly
in the world in such phrases as the lord's sphere" (ayatana) and "Vasudeva's
sphere" (ayatana), it is a place of abode that is called "base"; and in such phrases
as "the sphere of gold" and "the sphere of silver" it is a store (mine) that is called
"base." But in the Dispensation, in such passages as:
"And so in the delightful realm (ayatana)
Those flying in the air attend him" (A III 43),
it is a meeting place; and in such phrases as "The southern land is the realm
(ayatana) of cattle" (?) it is the locality of birth; and in such passages as "He
acquires the ability to be a witness of it... whenever there is an occasion (ayatana)
for it'" (M I 494; A I 258), it is a cause.
6.	And these various states of consciousness and its concomitants dwell in the
eye, etc., because they exist in dependence on them, so the eye, etc., are their place
of abode. And they frequent the eye, etc., because they have them [respectively] as
their [material] support and as their object, so the eye, etc., are their store. And the
eye, etc., are their meeting place because they meet together in one or other of them,
[using them] as physical basis, door, and object. And the eye, etc., are the locality
of their birth because they arise just there, having them as their respective supports
and objects. And the eye, etc., are their reason because they are absent when the
eye, etc., are absent.
7.	So for these reasons too these things are called "bases" in the sense of place
of abode, store, meeting place, locality of birth, and reason.
Consequently, in the sense already stated, it is an eye and that is a base, thus
it is the eye base ... They are mental data and those are a base, thus they are the
mental-data base.
This is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning.
8.	2. Character: Here too the exposition should be known as to the characteristic
of the eve and so on. But their characteristics should be understood in the way
given above in the Description of the Aggregates (XIV37ff.).
9.	3. As to just so much: as just so many.4 What is meant is this: The eye, etc., are
mental data too; that being so, why is "twelve bases" said instead of simply
"mental-data base?" It is for the sake of defining door-cum-object for the arising
of the six consciousness groups. And here they are stated as twelve since this is
how they are classed when so defined. [483]
10.	For onlv the eye base is the door of arising, and only the visible-data base is
the object, of the consciousness group comprised in a cognitive series containing
eye-consciousness. Likewise the others for the others.
3.	Akara means either a mine or a store (PED apparently believes in mining for
pearls—see ratanakarci).
4.	"Because of the absence of anything whatever not included in the twelve bases,
there is no arguing that they are more than twelve" (Vism-mht 510).
`495
Chapter XV
The Bases and Elements
But only one part of the mind base, in other words, the life-continuum mind,5
is the door of arising, and onlv the mental-data base not common to all is the
object, of the sixth [consciousness group].
So they are called "the twelve" because they define door-cum-object for the
arising of the six consciousness groups. This is how the exposition should be
known here as to just so much.
11. 4. As to order: here too, from among "order of arising," etc., mentioned
above (XIV211), only "order of teaching" is appropriate. For the eye is taught
first among the internal bases since it is obvious because it has as its objective
field what is visible with resistance (see last triad, Dhs 2). After that the ear base,
etc., which have as their objective fields what is invisible with resistance. Or
alternatively the eye base and ear base are taught first among the internal bases
because of their great helpfulness as [respective] causes for the "incomparable
of seeing" and the "incomparable of hearing" (see D III 250). Next, the three
beginning with the nose base. And the mind base is taught last because it has
as its resort the objective fields of the [other] five (M1295). But among the external
bases the visible-data base, etc., [are taught] each one next [to its corresponding
internal base] because they are the respective resorts of the eve base, and so on.
12.	Furthermore, their order may be understood as that in which the reasons
for consciousness's arising are defined; and it is said: "Due to eye and to visible
objects eye-consciousness arises, ... due to mind and mental objects mind-
consciousness arises" (M I 111).
This is how the exposition should be known here as to order.
13.	5. In brief and in detail: in brief the twelve bases are simply mentality-
materiality because the mind base and one part of the mental-data base are
included in mentality and the rest of the bases in materiality
14.	But in detail, firstly as regards the internal bases, the eye base is, as to kind,
simply eye sensitivity; but when it is classified according to condition, destiny
order [of beings], and person,6 it is of infinite variety. Likewise the four beginning
with the ear base. And the mind base, when classified according to profitable,
unprofitable, resultant, and functional consciousness, is of eighty-nine kinds or
of one hundred and twenty-one kinds,7 but it is of infinite variety when classified
5.	"'lit other words, the life-continuum mind': that which occurs twice in disturbance
(see Ch. XIV note 46). Only when there has been the occurrence of the life-continuum
in a state of disturbance (in a state of dissimilar occurrence) is there the arising of
adverting, not otherwise. Taking it thus as the reason for adverting, what is called
'life-continuum mind' is a door of arising. 'Not common to all' means not common to
eye-consciousness and the rest" (Vism-mht 510). See M I 293.
6.	"'Condition' is kamma, etc., 'destiny' is from hell upwards; 'order [of beings]' refers to
such species as elephants, horses, etc., or to the castes of the khattiyas (warrior nobles),
and so on; 'person' refers to any given living being's continuity" (Vism-mht 511).
7.	There are eightv-one mundane sorts of consciousness; and since there is no path
or fruition without jhana, when the four paths and four fruitions are multiplied by the
five jhanas, there are forty kinds of supramundane consciousness: 81+40 = 121.

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
according to physical basis, progress, and so on.8 The visible-data, sound, odour,
and flavour bases are of infinite variety when classified according to dissimilarity
condition, and so on.9 The tangible-data base is of three kinds as consisting of
earth element, fire element, and air element; [484] but when classified according
to condition, etc., it is of many kinds. The mental-data base is of many kinds
when classified according to the several individual essences of feeling,
perception, formations, subtle matter, and Nibbana (see Vibh 72).
This is how the exposition should be known in brief and in detail.
15. 6. As to how to be seen: here all formed bases should be regarded as having
no provenance and no destination. For thev do not come from anvwhere prior to
their rise, nor do they go anywhere after their fall. On the contrary, before their
rise they had no individual essence, and after their fall their individual essences
are completely dissolved. And they occur without mastery [being exercisable
over them] since they exist in dependence on conditions and in between the past
and the future. Hence thev should be regarded as having no provenance and no
destination.
Likewise they should be regarded as incurious and uninterested. For it does
not occur to the eye and the visible datum, etc., "Ah, that consciousness might
arise from our concurrence." And as door, physical basis, and object, they have
no curiosity about, or interest in, arousing consciousness. On the contrary it is
the absolute rule that eye-consciousness, etc., come into being with the union of
eye with visible datum, and so on. So they should be regarded as incurious and
uninterested.
16. Furthermore, the internal bases should be regarded as an empty village
because they are devoid of lastingness, pleasure, and self; and the external ones
as village-raiding robbers (S IV 175) because they raid the internal ones. And
this is said: "Bhikkhus, the eye is harassed by agreeable and disagreeable visible
objects" (S IV 175). Furthermore, the internal ones should be regarded as like the
six creatures (S IV 198-99) and the external ones as like their resorts.
This is how the exposition should be known here as to how to be seen.
This, firstly is the section of the detailed explanation dealing with the bases.
[B. Description of the Elements]
17. The "elements" next to that (XIV32) are the eighteen elements, that is to say,
eye element, visible-data element, eye-consciousness element; ear element, sound
element, ear-consciousness element; nose element, odour element, nose-
consciousness element; tongue element, flavour element, tongue-consciousness
element; bodv element, tangible-data element, body-consciousness element; mind
element, mental-data element, mind-consciousness element.
8.	"'Physical basis' is that consisting of the eye, etc.; according to that 'Progress' is a
painful progress, and the other three. 'And so on' refers to jhana, predominance, plane,
object, and so on" (Vism-mht 512).
9.	"Blue is similar to blue; it is dissimilar to any other colour. 'Condition' is kamma,
and so on" (Vism-mht 512).

The Bases and Elements
18.	Herein:
(1) As to meaning, (2) characteristic, et cetera,
(3) Order, (4) just so much, and (5) reckoning,
(6) Then condition, and (7) how to be seen—
Thus should be known the exposition.
19.	1. Herein, as to meaning: first the exposition of "eye," etc., should be known
individually as to meaning in the way beginning: It relishes (cakkliati), thus it is
an eye (<cakkhu); it makes visible (rupayati), thus it is a visible datum; [485] and the
consciousness of the eve is eye-consciousness (see §3).
As to meaning in general: (a) it sorts out (vidaluiti), (b) it assorts [well] (dhiyate),
(c) a sorting out (vidhana), (d) it is sorted out (vidhlyate) by means of that, or (e) it
causes to be sorted (dhiyati) here, thus it is a sort (dhatu = element).10
20.	(a) The mundane sorts (elements), when defined according to their
instrumentality sort out (vidahanti) the suffering of the round of rebirths, which
is of many kinds, just as the "sorts" (ores—see XI.20) of gold and silver, etc., do
gold and silver, and so on. (b) Thev assort [well] (dhlyante) with living beings, as
a burden does with burden bearers; they are borne (dhariyanti), is the meaning,
(c) And they are only mere sortings out (vidhana) of suffering because no mastery
is exercisable over them, (d) And by means of them as instruments the suffering
of the round of rebirths is continually being sorted out (anuvidhvyati) by living
beings, (e) And that [suffering], being sorted out (vihita) in this way, is caused to
be sorted (dluyati) into those [sorts (elements)]; it is caused to be placed in them,
is the meaning. So each thing (dhamma) among those beginning with the eye is
called a "sort" (dhatu—element) in the meaning just stated beginning "It sorts
out, it assorts well."
21. Furthermore, while the self of the sectarians does not exist with an
individual essence, not so these. These, on the contrary, are elements (dhatu)
since they cause [a state's] own individual essence to be borne (dharenti).n And
just as in the world the variously-coloured constituents of marble such as
malachite, cinnabar, etc., are called "elements," so too these [beginning with the
--
10.	The verb dal inti, the basis of all these derivatives, means literally "to put." "There
are five meanings stated, since the word dhatu (element, sort, 'putting') has its form
established (siddha) here by (a) the transitive (kattu), (b) the intransitive (kamma), (c) the
abstract noun (bliava), (d) the instrumental case (kdrana), and (e) the causative voice
(adhikarana). Supramundane elements do not sort out (vidahanti) the suffering of the
roimd of rebirths; on the contrary, they destroy (vidhamsenti) it. That is why 'mundane'
is specified" (Vism-mht 513).
11.	"'Are elements since they cause [a state's] own individual essence to be borne': here,
while the establishment of the word's form should be understood as "dadhatl ti dhatu
(it puts, sorts, thus it is an element),' still taking the word dha to share the meanings [of
both dadhati and dhareti (see XI. 104)], there is also the meaning of the active voice
different from the first, because the meanings of vidhana (sorting out) and dharana
(causing to bear) are unconnected. The causing of the bearing of mere individual
essences without any permanent living being, is a basic meaning of the word dhatu
(element), and so it is stated separately" (Vism-mht 513).

eye] are elements like those;12 for thev are the "variously-coloured" constituents
of knowledge and the knowable. Or just as the general term "elements" is used
for juices, blood, etc., which are constituents of the collection called the "carcass,"
when they are distinguished from each other by dissimilarity of characteristic,
so too the general term "elements" should be understood as used for the
constituents of the selfhood (personality) called "the pentad of aggregates"; for
these things beginning with the eye are distinguished from each other by
dissimilarity of characteristic.
22. Furthermore, "element" is a term for what is soulless; and for the purpose
of abolishing the perception of soul the Blessed One accordingly taught the
elements in such passages as "Bhikkhu, this man has six elements" (M III 239).
Therefore the exposition should be understood here firstly as to meaning thus:
it is an eye and that is an element, thus it is the eye-element ... It is mind-
consciousness and that is an element, thus it is mind-consciousness element.
23.	2. As to characteristic, et cetera: here too the exposition should be understood
as to the characteristic, etc., of the eye, and so on. And that should be understood
in the way given above in the Description of the Aggregates (XIV37ff.).
24.	3. As to order: here too, from among "order of arising," etc., mentioned
above (XIV211), only "order of teaching" is appropriate. It is set forth according
to successive definition of cause and fruit.13 For the pair, eve element and visible-
data element, are the cause and eye-consciousness element is the fruit. So in
each case.
25.	4. As to just so much: as just so many. What is meant is this: in various places
in the Suttas and Abhidhamma the following as well as other [486] elements are
met with—the illumination element, beauty element, base-consisting-of-
boundless-space element, base-consisting-of-boundless-consciousness element,
base-consisting-of-nothingness element, base-consisting-of-neither-perception-
nor-non-perception element, cessation-of-perception-and-feeling element (S II
150); sense-desire element, ill-will element, cruelty element, renunciation element,
non-ill-will element, non-cruelty element (Vibh 86); bodily-pleasure element,
bodily-pain element, joy element, grief element, equanimity element, ignorance
element (Vibh 85); initiative element, launching element, persistence element (S
V 66); inferior element, medium element, superior element (D III 215); earth
element, water element, fire element, air element, space element, consciousness
element (Vibh 82); formed element, unformed element (M III 63); the world of
many elements, of various elements (M I 70)—that being so, why is the
classification only made according to these eighteen instead of making it
12.	"'Are elements like those elements': here, just as the word "lion" (siha), which is
properly applicable to the bearer of a mane, [is used] of a man, so too the word
'element,' which is properly applicable to the constituents of marble, is used of the eye
and so on" (Vism-mht 513).
13.	"'Successive definition of cause and fruit' is just the state of cause and fruit" (Vism-
mht 514).
`499
Chapter XV
The Bases and Elements
according to all of them? Because, as far as individual essence is concerned, all
existing elements are included in that [classification].
26.	The visible data-element itself is the illumination element. The beauty
element is bound up with visible-data and so on. Why? Because it is the sign of
the beautiful. The sign of the beautiful is the beauty element and that does not
exist apart from visible data and so on. Or since the visible data, etc., that are
objects consisting of profitable kamma-result are themselves the beauty element,
that is thus merely visible data and so on. As regards the base-consisting-of-
boundless-space element, etc., the consciousness is mind-consciousness element
only, while the remaining [states] are the mental-data element. But the cessation-
of-perception-and-feeling element does not exist as an individual essence; for
that is merely the cessation of two elements.14
27.	The sense-desire element is either merely the mental-data element, according
as it is said, "Herein, what is the sense-desire element? It is the thought, applied
thought, ... wrong thinking, that is associated with sense desires" (Vibh 86), or
it is the eighteen elements, according as it is said: "Making the Avici hell the
lower limit and making the Paranimmitavasavatti deities the upper limit, the
aggregates, elements, bases, materiality, feeling, perception, formations, and
consciousness that are in this interval, that belong here, are included here: these
are called the sense desire element" (Vibh 86). [487]
28.	The renunciation element is the mental-data element; also, because of the
passage, "Also all profitable states are the renunciation element" (Vibh 86), it is
the mind-consciousness element too. The elements of ill-will, cruelty, non-ill-
will, non-cruelty bodily pleasure, bodilv pain, joy grief, equanimity ignorance,
initiative, launching, and persistence are the mental-data element too.
29.	The inferior, medium, and superior elements are the eighteen elements
themselves; for inferior eyes, etc., are the inferior element, and medium and
superior eyes, etc., are the medium and superior elements. But literally speaking,
the unprofitable mental-data element and mind-consciousness element are the
inferior element; both these elements, when mundane profitable or mundane
indeterminate, and the eye element, etc., are the medium element; but the
supramundane mental-data element and mind-consciousness element are the
superior element.
30.	The earth, fire, and air elements are the tangible-data element; the water
element and the space element are the mental-data element only; "consciousness
element" is a term summarizing the seven consciousness elements beginning
with eye-consciousness.
31.	Seventeen elements and one part of the mental-data element are the formed
element; but the unformed element is one part of the mental-data element only.
The "world of many elements, of various elements" is merely what is divided up
into the eighteen elements.
14. Tt is the mere cessation of the mind-consciousness element and mental-data
element because it is the ceasedness of thought-arisings in the fourth immaterial
state" (Vism-mht 514).

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
So they are given as eighteen because, as to individual essence, all existing
elements are included in that [classification].
32.	Furthermore, they are stated as eighteen for the purpose of eliminating the
kind of perception to be found in those who perceive a soul in consciousness,
the individual essence of which is cognizing; for there are beings who perceive
a soul in consciousness, the individual essence of which is cognizing. And so
the Blessed One, who was desirous of eliminating the long-inherent perception
of a soul, has expounded the eighteen elements thus making evident to them
not onlv consciousness's multiplicity when classed as eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-
and body-consciousness elements, and mind, and mind-consciousness elements,
but also its impermanence, which is due to its existing in dependence on eve-
cum-visible-data, etc., as conditions.
33.	What is more, the inclinations of those who are teachable in this way [have
to be considered]; and in order to suit the inclinations of beings who are teachable
by a teaching that is neither too brief nor too long, eighteen are expounded. For:
By methods terse and long as need may be
He taught the Dhamma, so that from beings' hearts,
If they have wit to learn, the dark departs
Melting in the Good Dhamma's brilliancy
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to just so much.
34. 5. As to reckoning: the eye-element, firstly is reckoned as one thing according
to kind, [488] namely eye sensitivity. Likewise, the ear, nose, tongue, body visible-
data, sound, odour, and flavour elements are reckoned as ear sensitivity and so
on (XIV37ff.). But the tangible-data element is reckoned as three things, namely
earth, fire and air. The eye-consciousness element is reckoned as two things,
namely profitable and unprofitable kamma-result; and likewise the conscious-
ness elements of the ear, nose, tongue, and body. The mind element is reckoned
as three things, namely, five-door adverting (70), and profitable (39) and
unprofitable (55) resultant receiving. The mental-data element as twenty things,
namely, three immaterial aggregates, sixteen kinds of subtle matter, and the
unformed element (see Vibh 88).15 Mind-consciousness element is reckoned as
seventy-six things, namely, the remaining profitable, unprofitable, and
indeterminate consciousnesses. This is how the exposition should be understood
as to reckoning.
35. 6. Condition: the eye element, firstly, is a condition, in six ways, namely,
dissociation, pre-nascence, presence, non-disappearance, support, and faculty
15. In XIV35-70, the material instances listed total 28, that is, 4 primary elements, 9
sense faculties (excluding the tangible-data faculty, which is the 3 elements except
water), and 15 kinds of subtle materiality beginning with the femininity faculty (cf.
treatment at Dhs §596). Other lists, however, sometimes give a total of 26 kinds, that is,
10 sense faculties (including the tangible-data faculty which is the 3 primary elements)
and 16 kinds of subtle materiality that is, the above-mentioned 15 plus the water
element, which is listed then after the space element (cf. treatment at Dhs §653 and list
at M-a II 261). See Table I.
`501
Chapter XV
The Bases and Elements
for the eye-consciousness element. The visible-data element is a condition, in
four ways, namely prenascence, presence, non-disappearance, and object, for
the eye-consciousness element. Similarly with the ear-element and the sound-
element for the ear-consciousness element and so on.
36. The adverting mind element (70) is a condition, as the five conditions,
namely: proximity contiguity, absence, disappearance, and proximity-decisive-
support, for these five [beginning with the eye-consciousness element]. And
these five are so too for the receiving mind element ((39), (55)). And so is the
receiving mind element for the investigating mind-consciousness element ((40),
(41), (56)). And so is that too for the determining mind-consciousness element
(71). And so is the determining mind-consciousness element for impulsion mind-
consciousness element. But the impulsion mind-consciousness element is a
condition, as the six conditions, namely as the five already stated and as repetition
condition, for the immediately following impulsion mind-consciousness element.
This, firstly is the wav in the case of the five doors.
37.	In the case of the mind door, however, the life-continuum mind-
consciousness element is a condition, as the previously-stated five conditions,
for the adverting mind-consciousness element (71). And the adverting mind-
consciousness element is so for the impulsion mind-consciousness element.
38.	The mental-data element is a condition in many wavs, as conascence,
mutuality support, association, presence, non-disappearance, etc.,16 for the seven
consciousness elements. The eye element, etc., and some of the mental-data
element,17 are conditions, as object condition, etc., for some of the mind-
consciousness element.
39.	And not only are the eye and visible data, etc., conditions for the eye-
consciousness element, etc., [respectively], but also light, etc., are too. Hence the
former teachers said: "Eye-consciousness arises due to eye, visible datum, light,
and attention. [489] Ear-consciousness arises due to ear, sound, aperture, and
attention. Nose-consciousness arises due to nose, odour, air, and attention.
Tongue-consciousness arises due to tongue, flavour, water, and attention. Body-
consciousness arises due to body tangible datum, earth, and attention. Mind-
consciousness arises due to life-continuum-mind,18 mental datum, and attention."
This is in brief. But the kinds of conditions will be explained in detail in the
Description of Dependent Origination (XVII.66ff.).
This is how the exposition should be understood here as to condition.
40. 7. How to be seen: the meaning is that here too the exposition should be
understood as to how they are to be regarded. For all formed elements are to be
--
16.	"Here the word 'etc.' stands for the mind-consciousness element's states where
suitable as root-cause, predominance, kamma, kamma-result, nutriment, faculty jhana,
and path conditions" (Vism-mht 516).
17.	"I.e. subtle materiality and Nibbana" (Vism-mht 516).
18.	"'Life-continuum mind' is the life-continuum consciousness occurring twice in
disturbance" (Vism-mht 516).
`502

Part 3: Understanding (Panna)
regarded as secluded from the past and future,19 as void of any lastingness,
beauty pleasure, or self, and as existing in dependence on conditions.
41.	Individually, however, the eye element should be regarded as the surface of
a drum, the visible-data element as the drumstick, and the eye-consciousness
element as the sound. Likewise, the eye element should be regarded as the surface
of a looking-glass, the visible-data element as the face, and the eye-consciousness
element as the image of the face. Or else, the eye-element should be regarded as
sugarcane or sesame, the visible-data element as the [sugarcane] mill or the
[sesame] wheel rod, and the eye-consciousness element as the sugarcane juice
or the sesame oil. Likewise, the eye-element should be regarded as the lower fire-
stick, the visible-data element as the upper fire-stick,20 and the eye-consciousness
element as the fire. So too in the case of the ear and so on.
42.	The mind element, however, should be regarded as the forerunner and
follower of eye-consciousness, etc., as that arises.
As to the mental-data element, the feeling aggregate should be regarded as a
dart and as a stake, the perception and formations aggregates as a disease
owing to their connection with the dart and stake of feeling. Or the ordinary
man's perception should be regarded as an empty fist because it produces pain
through [disappointed] desire; or as a forest deer [with a scarecrow] because it
apprehends the sign incorrectly. And the formations aggregate should be
regarded as men who throw one into a pit of hot coals, because thev throw one
into rebirth-linking, or as thieves pursued by the king's men because they are
pursued by the pains of birth; or as the seeds of a poison-tree, because they are
the root-cause of the aggregates' continuity which brings all kinds of harm.
And materiality should be regarded as a razor-wheel (see J-a IV 3), because it is
the sign of various kinds of dangers.
The unformed element, however, should be regarded as deathless, as peace,
as safety. Why? Because it is the opposite of all ill. [490]
43. The mind-consciousness element should be regarded as a forest monkey,
because it does not stay still on its object; or as a wild horse, because it is difficult
to tame; or as a stick flung into the air, because it falls anyhow; or as a stage
dancer, because it adopts the guise of the various defilements such as greed and
hate.
The fifteenth chapter called "The Description of the Bases
and Elements" in the Treatise on the Development of
Understanding in the Path of Purification composed for
the purpose of gladdening good people.
19.	"Formed elements are secluded in both instances (i.e. when past and future)
because their individual essences are unapprehendable then" (Vism-mht 516).
20.	Adhararani (adho-arani)—"lower fire-stick" and uttararani (uttara-arani)—"upper
fire-stick" are not in PED as such.
