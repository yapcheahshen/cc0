Chapter I
Description of Virtue
(Stla-niddesa)
[I. Introductory]
1. [1]	"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and understanding,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle" (S113).
This was said. But why was it said? While the Blessed One was living at Savatthi,
it seems, a certain deity came to him in the night and in order to do away with his
doubts, he asked this question:
"The inner tangle and the outer tangle~
This generation is entangled in a tangle.
And so I ask of Gotama this question:
Who succeeds in disentangling this tangle?" (S113).
2. Here is the meaning in brief. Tangle is a term for the network of craving. For
that is a tangle in the sense of lacing together, like the tangle called network of
branches in bamboo thickets, etc., because it goes on arising again and again up
and down1 among the objects [of consciousness] beginning with what is visible.
But it is called the inner tangle and the outer tangle because it arises [as craving] for
one's own requisites and another's, for one's own person and another's, and for
the mternal and external bases [for consciousness]. Since it arises in this way this
generation is entangled in a tangle. As the bamboos, etc., are entangled by the bamboo
tangle, etc., so too this generation, in other words, this order of living beings, is all
entangled by the tangle of craving~the meaning is that it is intertwined, interlaced
by it. [2] And because it is entangled like this, so I ask of Gotama this question, that is
why I ask this. He addressed the Blessed One by his clan name as Gotama. Who

1. "From a visible datiun sometimes as far down as a mental datmn, or vice versa,
following the order of the six kinds of objects of consciousness as given in the teaching"
(Vism-nilit 5, see XV32).
`64
succeeds in disentangling this tangle: who may disentangle this tangle that keeps the
three kinds of existence entangled in this way?—What he asks is, who is capable of
disentangling it?
3.	However, when questioned thus, the Blessed One, whose knowledge of all
things is unimpeded, deity of deities, excelling Sakka (Ruler of Gods), excelling
Bicduna, fearless in the possession of the four kinds of perfect confidence, wielder
of the ten powers, all-seer with imobstructed knowledge, uttered this stanza in
reply to explain the meaning:
"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and understanding,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."
4.	My task is now to set out the true sense,
Divided into virtue and the rest,
Of this same verse composed by the Great Sage.
There are here in the Victor's Dispensation
Seekers gone forth from home to homelessness,
And who although desiring purity
Have no right knowledge of the siue straight way
Comprising virtue and the other two,
Right hard to find, that leads to pmity——~
Who, though they strive, here gain no purity.
To tliem I shall expoimd the conifortiiig Path
Of Purification, pure in expositions,
Relying on the teaching of the dwellers
In the Great Monastery;2 let all those
Good men who do desire piuity
Listen intently to my exposition.
5.	Herein purification should be understood as Nibbana, which being devoid of
all stains, is utterly pure. The path of purification is the path to that purification; it is
the means of approach that is called the path. The meaning is, I shall expound that
path of piuification.
6.	In some instances this path of pm ification is taught by insight alone,3 according
as it is said:
2.	The Great Monastery (Maliaviliara) at Aniuadhapiaa in Sri Laiika.
3.	"The words 'insight alone' are meant to exclude not virtue, etc., but serenity (i.e.
jhtitia), which is the opposite niunber in the pair, serenity and insight. This is for
emphasis. But the word 'alone' actually excludes only that concentration with distinction
[of jhana]; for concentration is classed as both access and absorption (see IV32). Taking
this stanza as the teaching for one whose vehicle is insight does not imply that there is
no concentration; for no insight comes about without momentary concentration. And
again, insight should be imderstood as the three contemplations of impermanence,
pain, and not-self; not contemplation of impermanence alone" (Vism-nilit 9-10).
"Formations are all impermanent:
When he sees thus with understanding
And turns away from what is ill,
That is the path to pm'ity" (Dhp 277). [3】
And iii some instances by jhaiia and imderstcuidmg, according as it is said:
"He is near imto Nibbana
lit whom are jhaiia and imderstcuuiiiig" (Dhp 372).
And iii some instances by deeds (kamma), etc., according as it is said:
"By deeds, vision and righteousness,
By virtue, the subliniest life~
By these are mortals purified,
And not by lineage and wealth" (M III 262).
And iii some instances by virtue, etc., according as it is said:
"He who is possessed of constant virtue,
Who has imderstaiidmg, and is concentrated,
Who is strenuous and diligent as well,
Will cross the flood so difficult to cross" (S153).
And iii some instances by the foiuieiations of mindfulness, etc., according as it
is said: "Bhikkhus, this path is the only way for the purification of beings ... for the
realization of Nibbaiia, that is to say the fom' foimdations of mindfulness" (D II
290); and similarly in the case of the light efforts, and so on. But in the answer to
this question it is taught by virtue and the other two.
7. Here is a brief coimnentary [on the stanza]. Established well in virtue: standing
on virtue. It is onlv one actually fulfilling virtue who is here said to "stand on
virtue" So the meaning here is this: being established well m virtue by fiilfillmg
virtue. A man: a living being. Wise: possessing the kind of imderstaiidiiig that is
born of kamma by means of a rebii'th-linkiiig with triple loot-cause. Develops
consciousness mid tuiderstmiding: develops both concentration and insight. For it is
concentration that is described here tinder the heading of "consciousness," and
insight under that of "understanding."4 Ardent (atapin): possessing energy. For it is
energy that is called "ardour" (atapm) in the sense of burning up and consuming
(atnpana-paritapana) defilements. He has that, thus he is ardent. Sagacious: it is

4. "'Develops, applies to both /consciousness, and 'undeistanding/ But are they
mimdaite 01 siipraiiumdaiie? Tliey are supramundane, because the sublime goal is
described； for one developing them is said to disentangle the tangle of craving by cutting
it off at the path moment, and that is not mundane. But the mundane are included here
too because they immediately precede, since supramundane (see Ch. Ill n._5)
concentration and insight are impossible without numdane concentration and insight
to precede them; for without the access and absorption concentration in one whose
vehicle is serenity, or without the momentary concentration in one whose vehicle is
insight, and without the gateways to liberation (see XXI.66f.), the supianumdai'ie can
never in either case be reached" (Vism-inlit 13). "With triple root-cause" means with
non-greed, none-hate, and non-delusion.

`8
imderstaiiding that is called "sagacity"; possessing that, is the meaning. This word
shows protective understanding. For imderstaiidmg is mentioned three times in
the reply to the question. Herein, the first is naive understandmg, the second is
undeistanding consisting in insight, while the third is the protective understanding
that guides all affairs. He sees fear (bhmjam ikklmti) in the roiuui of rebirths, thus he
is a bhikkhu. He succeeds in disentangling this tangle: [4] Just as a man standing on the
groiuui and taking lip a well-sharpened knife might disentangle a great tangle of
bamboos, so too, he^this bhikkhu who possesses the six tilings, namely this virtue,
and this concentration described imder the heading of consciousness, and this
threefold understanding, and this ardour—standing on the groirnd of virtue and
taking up with the hand of protective-imderstaiiding exerted by the power ot energy
the knife of insight-tinderstanding well-sharpened on the stone of concentration,
might disentangle, cut away and demolish all the tangle of craving that had
overgrown his own life's continuity. But it is at the moment of the path that he is
said to be disentangling that tangle; at the moment of fruition he has disentangled
the tangle and is worthy of the highest offerings m the world with its deities. That
is why the Blessed One said:
"When a wise man, established well in virtue,
Develops consciousness and imdei standing,
Then as a bhikkhu ardent and sagacious
He succeeds in disentangling this tangle."
8. Herein there is nothing for him to do about the [naive] luiderstaiiding on
account of which he is called wise; for that has been established in him simply by
the influence of previous kamma. But the words ardent and sagacious mean that by
persevering with energy of the kind here described and by acting in full awareness
with imderstandiiig he should, having become well established in virtue, develop
the serenity and insight that are described as coiicentrntion and luiderstnnding. This
is how the Blessed One shows the path of purification imder the headings of virtue,
concentration, and imderstaiuimg there.
9.	What has been shown so far is the three trainings, the dispensation that is
good in three ways, the necessary condition for the threefold clear-vision, etc., the
avoidance of the two extremes and the cultivation of the middle way the means to
surmotmtmg the states of loss, etc., the abandoning of defilements in three aspects,
prevention of transgression etc., piuification from the three kinds of defilements,
and the reason for the states of stream-entiy and so on. How?
10.	Here the tramiiig of higher virtue is shown by virtue; the traming of higher
consciousness, by concentration) and the training of higher understanding, by
understanding.
The dispensation's goodness in the beginning is shown by virtue. Because of the
passage, "And what is the beginning of profitable things? Virtue that is quite
purified" (S V 143), and because of the passage beginning, "The not doing of any
evil" (Dhp 183), virtue is the beginning of the dispensation. And that is good because
it brings about the special qualities of non-remorse,5 and so on. Its goodness in the
5. One who is virtuous has nothing to be remorseful about.
`9
middle is shown by concentrntion. [5] Because of the passage beginning, "Entei.ing
upon the profitable" (Dhp 183), concentration is the middle of the dispensation.
And that is good because it brings about the special qualities of supernormal power,
and so on. Its goodness in the end is shown by understmiding. Because of the passage,
"The piuifyiiig of one's own mind—this is the Buddhas' dispensation" (Dhp 183),
and because understanding is its culmination, luiderstnnding is the end of the
dispensation. And that is good because it brings about equipoise with respect to
the desired and the imdesired. For this is said:
"Just as a solid massive rock
Remains luishaken by the wind,
So too, in face of blame and praise
The wise remain immovable" (Dhp 81).
11. Likewise the necessary condition for the triple clear-vision is shown by virtue.
For with the support of perfected virtue one arrives at the three kinds of clear-
vision, but nothing besides that. The necessary condition for the six kinds of direct-
knowledge is shown by concentration. For with the support of perfected
concentration one arrives at the six kinds of direct-knowledge, but nothing besides
that. The necessary condition for the categories of discrixnmation is shown by
understanding. For with the support of perfected understanding one arrives at the
four kinds of disciimination, but not for any other reason.6
And the avoidance of the extreme called devotion to indulgence of sense desires
is shown by virtue. The avoidance of the extreme called devotion to mortification
of self is shown by concentration. The cultivation of the middle way is shown by
luiderstnnding.
12.	Likewise the menus for surmoiuiting the states of loss is shown by virtue; the means
for siumounting the element of sense desires, by concentrntion; and the means for
surmoiuiting all becoming, by tuiderstanduig.
And the nbmidoning of defilements by substitution of opposites is shown by virtue;
that by suppression is shown by coiicentrntiou; and that by cutting off is shown by
understanding.
13.	Likezvise prevention ofdefileinentsf trmisgression is shown by virtue; prevention of
obsession (by defilement) is shown by concentration; prevention of inherent
tendencies is shown by iinderstatiding.
And fmrificntion from the defilement of misconduct is shown by virtue; purification
from the defilement of craving, by concentration; and purification from the
defilement of (false) views, by tinderstmiding.
6. The three kinds of clear-vision are: recollection of past lives, knowledge of the
passing away and reappearance of beings (divine eye), and knowledge of destruction
of cankers (M I 22-23). The six kinds of direct-knowledge are: knowledge of
supernormal power, the divine ear element, penetration of niinds, recollection of past
lives, knowledge of the passing away and reappearance of beings, and knowledge of
destruction of cankers (M134^35). The four disci iniiiiations are those of meaning, law,
language, and intelligence (A II160).
`10
14.	[6] Likewise the reason for the states of stream-entiy and once-retmn is shown
by virtue; that for the state of non-rettirn, by concentrntion; that for Araliantsliip by
tinderstmiduig. For the stream-enterer is called "perfected in the kinds of virtue";
and likewise the once-returner. But the non-returner is called ''perfected in con-
centration/' And the Araliant is called "perfected in tindei standing" (see A1233).
15.	So thus far these nine and other like triads of special qualities have been shown,
that is, the three trainings, the dispensation that is good in three ways, the necessary
condition for the threefold clear-vision, the avoidance of the two extremes and the
cultivation of the middle way the means for surmoiuitmg the states of loss, etc.,
the abandoning of defilements in three aspects, prevention of transgression, etc.,
purification from the three kinds of defilements, and the reason for the states of
stream-entiy, and so on.
[II. Virtue]
16.	However, even when this path of piuification is shown in this way trnder the
headings of virtue, concentration and imderstaiidmg, each comprising various
special qualities, it is still only shown extremely briefly. And so since that is
iiisufficient to help all, there is, in order to show it in detail, the following set of
questions dealing in the first place with virtue:
(i)	What is virtue?
(ii)	In what sense is it virtue?
(iii)	What are its characteristic, fimction, nianifestation, and proximate
cause?
What are the benefits of virtue?
How many kinds of virtue are there?
What is the defiling of it?
What is the cleansing of it?
17. Here are the answers:
(i) What is virtue? It is the states beginning with volition present in one who
abstains from killing living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the
duties. For this is said in the Patisambhida: "What is virtue? There is virtue as
volition, virtue as conscioiisness-coricoinitant,7 virtue as restraint, [7] virtue as non-
iransgression" (Patis 144).
Herein, virtue as volition is the volition present in one who abstains from killing
living things, etc., or in one who fulfils the practice of the duties. Virtue as consciousness-
concomitant is the abstinence in one who abstains from killing living things, and so on.
Fiu tliermore, virtue as volition is the seven volitions [that accompany the first sevenl of
the [ten] coiuses of action (kamma) in one who abandons the killing of living tilings,
and so on. Virtue ns consciousness-concomitant is the [three remaining] states consisting
of non-covetousness, non-ill will, and right view, stated in the way beginning,
"Abandoning covetousness, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness" (DI 71).
7. "Consciousness-concoinitants" (cetasika) is a collective term for feeling, perception,
and formation, variously subdivided; in other words, aspects of mentality that arise
together with consciousness.
`11
18. Virtue ns restraint should be imderstood here as restraint in five ways: restraint
by the rules of the community (pntimokkhn), restraint by mindfulness, restraint
by knowledge, restraint by patience, and restraint by energy. Herein, ^restraint
by the Patimokkha" is this: "He is furnished, fully furnished, with this
Patimokkha restraint. (Vibh 246)〃 "Restraint by mindfulness" is this: "He guards
the eye faculty, enters upon restraint of the eye faculty" (D I 70). "Restraint by
knowledge" is this:
"The currents in the world that flow, Ajita,"
said the Blessed One,
"Are stemmed by means of mindfulness;
Restraint of currents I proclaim,
By understanding they are dammed" (Sn 1035);
and use of requisites is here combined with this. But what is called "l'estiaint by
patience" is that given in the way beginning, "He is one who bears cold and heat〃
(M110). And what is called ''restraint by energy" is that given in the way beginning,
"He does not endure a thought of sense desires when it arises" (M 111); piuification
of livelihood is here combined with this. So this fivefold restraint, and the abstinence,
in clansmen who dread evil, from any chance of transgression met with, should
all be imderstood to be "virtue as restraint/"
Virtue as non-transgression is the non-traiisgression, by body or speech, of precepts
of virtue that have been imdertaken.
This, in the first place, is the answer to the question, "What is virtue?" [8] Now,
as to the rest——
19.	(ii) In what sense is it virtue? It is vii tue (slla) in the sense of composing (silniin).8
What is this composing? It is either a coordinating (samadhann), meaning non-
mconsistencv of bodily action, etc., due to viituousness; or it is an upholding
(iipadharnna),8 meaning a state of basis (adhara) owing to its serving as foimdation
for profitable states. For those who imderstand etymology admit only these two
meanings. Others, however, comment on the meaning here in the way beginning,
"The meaning of virtue (slla) is the meaning of head (sira), the meaning of virtue is
the meaning of cool (sJtnla)/,
20.	(iii) Now, what are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate
cause? Here:
The characteristic of it is composing
Even when analyzed in various ways,
As visibility is of visible data
Even when analyzed in various ways.
Just as visibleness is the characteristic of the visible-data base even when analyzed
into the various categories of blue, yellow, etc., because even when analyzed into
these categories it does not exceed visible-ness, so also this same composing,
described above as the cooidmatiiig of bodily action, etc., and as the foimdation of
8. SJlana and upadharmin in this meaning (cf. Ch. I, §141 and sandharmia, XIV61) are
not in PED.
`12
profitable states, is the characteristic ol virtue even when analyzed Into the various
categories of volition, etc., because even when analyzed into these categories it
does not exceed the state of coordination and foimdation.
21.	While such is its characteristic:
Its function has a double sense:
Action to stop misconduct, then
Achievement as the quality
Of blamelessness in virtuous men.
So what is called virtue should be imderstood to have the function (nature) of
stopping misconduct as its fiuiction (natme) in the sense of action, and a blameless
function (nature) as its function (nature) in the sense of acl'iievement. For under
[these headings oi] chaiacteristic, etc., it is action (kicca) 01 it is achievement (sampntti)
that is called "fimction〃 (rasa~natme).
22.	Now, virtue, so say those who know,
Itself as piuity will show;
And for its proximate cause they tell
The pair, conscience and shame, as well. [9]
"This virtue is maiiifested as the kinds of purity stated thus: "Bodilv piuity verbal
piuity, mental purity(A I 271); it is manifested, comes to be apprehended, as a
piue state. But conscience and shaine are said by those who know to be its proximate
cause; its near reason, is the meaning. For when conscience and shame are in
existence, viitue arises and persists; and when they are not, it neither arises nor
persists.
This is how virtue's characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause,
should be imderstood.
23. (iv) What are the benefits of virtue? Its benefits are the acquisition of the
several special qualities beginning with non-remorse. For this is said: "Ananda,
profitable habits (virtues) have non-remorse as their aim and non-remorse as their
benefit" (A V 1). Also it is said further: "Householder, there are these five benefits
for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. What five? Here, householder, one who
is vii tuoiis, possessed of virtue, obtains a large fortime as a consequence of diligence;
this is the first benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, of one
who is virtuous, possessed of vii tue, a fail name is spread abroad; this is the second
benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, whenever one who is
virtuous, possessed of viitue, enters an assembly whether of kliattiyas (warrior-
nobles) or brahmans or householders or ascetics, he does so without fear or
hesitation; this is the third benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of vii tue. Again,
one who is virtuous, possessed of virtue, dies unconfused; this is the fourth benefit
for the virtuous in the perfecting of virtue. Again, one who is virtuous, possessed
of virtue, on the breakup of the body, after death, reappears in a happy destiny, in
the heavenly world; this is the fifth benefit for the virtuous in the perfecting of
virtue" (DII86). There are also the many benefits of virtue beginning with being
dear and loved and ending with destruction of cankers described in the passage
beginning, "If a bhikkhu should wish, 'May I be dear to my fellows in the life of
`13
piuity and loved by them, held in respect and honoured by them/ let him perfect
the virtues" (M133). This is how virtue has as its benefits the several special qualities
beginning with non-remorse. [10]
24. Fiu'thermore:
Dare anyone a limit place
On benefits that virtue brings,
Without which virtue clansmen find
No footing iii the dispensation?
No Ganges, and no Yamuna
No Sarabhu, SarassathI,
Or flowing Aciravatl,
Or noble River of Mali!,
Is able to wash out the stain
In tilings that breathe here in the world;
For only virtue's water can
Wash out the stain in living things.
No breezes that come bringing rain,
No balm of yellow sandalwood,
No necklaces beside, or gems
Or soft effulgence of moonbeams,
Can here avail to calm and soothe
Men's fevers in this world; whereas
This noble, this supremely cool,
Well-guarded virtue quells the flame.
Where is there to be found the scent
That can with virtue's scent compare,
And that is borne against the wind
As easily as with it? Where
Can such another stair be foiuui
That climbs, as vii tue does, to heaven?
Or yet another door that gives
Onto the City of Nibbana?
Shine as they may, there are no kings
Adorned with jewellery and pearls
That shine as does a man restraiiied
Adorned with virtue's ornament.
Virtue entirely does away
With dread of self-blame and the like;
Their vii tue to the virtuous
Gives gladness always by its fame.
From this brief sketch it may be known
How virtue brings reward, and how
This root of all good qualities
Robs of its power every fault.
`14
25. (v) Now, here is the answer to the question, How many kinds of virtue are
THERE?
1.	Firstly all this virtue is of one kind by reason of its own characteristic of
composing.
2.	It is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.
3.	Likewise as that of good behavioiu. and that of the beginning of the life of
purity
4.	As abstinence and non-abstinence,
5.	As dependent and independent,
6.	As temporary and lifelong,
7.	As limited and Linlimited,
8.	As mimdane and supranumdane. fill
9.	It is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.
10.	Likewise as giving precedence to self, giving precedence to the world, and
giving precedence to the Dhamma,
11.	As adhered to, not adhered to, and tranquillized.
12.	As purified, unpiiiified, and dubious.
13.	As that of the tiainei, that of the non-tramer, and that of the neither-tramer-
nor-non-tramer.
14.	It is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, of stagnation, of distinction,
of penetration.
15.	Likewise as that of bhikkhus, of bhikkhiuiis, of the not-fully-admitted, of
the lait^
16.	As natural, customary necessaiy due to previous causes,
17.	As virtue of Patimokkha restraint, of restraint of sense faculties, of
piuification of livelihood, and that concerning requisites.
18.	It is of five kinds as virtue consisting in limited purification, etc.; for this is
said in the Patisambhida: "Five kiiuis of virtue: virtue consisting in limited
purification, vii tue consisting in lu'diiiiited purification, vii tue consisting in Itilfilled
piuification, viitue consisting in unadheied-to piuification, viitue consisting in
tranquillized piuification(Patis 142).
19.	Likewise as abandoning, refraining, volition, restraint, and non-
traiisgression.
26. 1. Herein, in the section dealing with that of one kind, the meaning should
be understood as already stated.
2. In the section dealing with that of two kinds: fiilfillmg a haining precept
announced by the Blessed One tluis: "This should be done" is keeping; not doing what
is prohibited by him thus: "This should not be done" is nvoidirig. Herein, the word-
meaiiiiig is this: they keep (carmiti) within that, they proceed as people who fulfil the
virtues, tlnis it is keeping (carittn); they preserve, they protect, they avoid, thus it is
`15
avoiding. Herein, keeping is accomplished by faith and energy； mmdiiig, by faith and
mindfiilness. This is how it is of two kinds as keeping and avoiding.
27.	3. In the second dyad good behaviour is the best kind of behavioiu. Good
behaviour itself is that of good beJinviour; 01 what is announced for the sake of good
behaviour is that of good belinznour. This is a term for virtue other than that which
has livelihood as eighth.9 It is the initial stage of the life of piuity consisting in the
path, thus it is that of the beginning of the life ofptirity. This is a term for the virtue
that has livelihood as eighth. It is the initial stage of the path because it has actually
to be purified in the prior stage too. Hence it is said: "But his bodily action, his
verbal action, and his livelihood have already been purified earlier" (M III 289). Or
the trammg precepts called "lesser and minor" (D II 154) [12] are that of good
behaviour; the rest are that of the beginning of the life of purity. Or what is included in
the Double Code (the bhikkluis/ and bhikklulnis, Patiinokklia) is that of the begituiing
of the life of yurit]/; and that included in the duties set out in the Kliandliakas [of
Vinaya] is that of good behaviour. Through its perfection that of the beginning of the life
ofjmrity comes to be perfected. Hence it is said also "that this bhikkhu shall fulfil
the state consisting in the beginning of the life of purity without having fulfilled
the state consisting in good behaviour—that is not possible" (A III 14-15). So it is
of two kinds as that of good behaviour and that of the beginning of the life of
purity.
28.	4. In the third dyad virtue as nbstinence is simply abstention from killing living
tilings, etc.; the other kinds consisting in volition, etc., are virtue as noii-nbstinence.
So it is of two kinds as abstinence and non-abstinence.
29.	5. In the fourth dyad there are two kinds of dependence: dependence through
craving and dependence through [false] views. Herein, that produced by one who
wishes for a fortimate kind of becoming thus, "Through this virtuous conduct
[rite] I shall become a [great] deity or some [minoi] deity" (M 1102), is dependent
through craving. That produced through such [false] view about purification as
'Turification is through virtuous conduct" (Vibh 374) is dependent through [false]
view. But the supranumdane, and the numdane that is the prerequisite for the
aforesaid supi.anumdane, are independent. So it is of two kinds as dependent and
independent
30.	6. In the fifth dyad temporary viitue is that imdertaken after deciding on a
time limit. Lifelong virtue is that practiced in the same way but undertaking it for
as long as life lasts. So it is of two kinds as temporaiy and lifelong.
31.	7. In the sixth dyad the limited is that seen to be limited by gain, fame, relatives,
limbs, or life. The opposite is unlimited. And this is said in the Patisanibl'iida: "What
is the virtue that has a limit? There is virtue that has gain as its limit, there is virtue
that has fame as its limit, there is virtue that has relatives as its limit, there is virtue
that has limbs as its limit, there is vii tue that has life as its limit. What is virtue that
9. The three kinds of profitable bodily kanmia or action (not killing or stealing or
mdidgiiig in sexual misconduct), the four kinds of profitable verbal kanuna or action
(refiaiiiiiig from lying, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip), and right livelihood
as the eighth.
`16
has gain as its limit? Here someone with gain as cause, with gain as condition,
with gain as reason, transgresses a training precept as undertaken: that virtue has
gain as its limit" (Patis I 43), [13] and the rest should be elaborated in the same
way. Also in the answer dealing with the tinlimited it is said: "What: is virtue that
does not have gain as its limit? Here someone does not, with gain as cause, with
gain as condition, with gain as reason, even arouse the thought of transgressmg a
training precept as imdertaken, how then shall he actually transgress it? That virtue
does not have gain as its limit" (Patis 144), and the rest should be elaborated in the
same way So it is of two kinds as limited and iinlimited.
32. 8. In the seventh dyad all virtue subject to cankers is mtuuinne; that not subject
to cankers is siiprmmuidnne. Herein, the muiidmie brings about improvement in futiue
becoming and is a prerequisite for the escape from becoming, according as it is
said: "Discipline is for the purpose of restramt, restraint is for the purpose of non-
remorse, non-remorse is for the purpose of gladdening, gladdening is for the
purpose of happiness, happiness is for the purpose of tranquillity, tranquillity is
for the purpose of bliss, bliss is for the purpose of concentration, concentration is
for the purpose of correct knowledge and vision, correct knowledge and vision is
for the purpose of dispassion, dispassion is for the purpose of fading away [of
greed], fading away is for the purpose of deliverance, deliverance is for the purpose
of knowledge and vision of deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliverance is
for the purpose of complete extinction [of craving, etc.] through not clinging. Talk
has that purpose, counsel has that purpose, support has that purpose, giving ear
has that purpose, that is to say, the liberation of the mind through not clinging"
`17
(Viii V 164). The suprnnnuidmie brings about the escape from becoming and is the
plane of reviewing knowledge. So it is of two kinds as numdane and supranumdane.
33.	9. In the first of the triads the inferior is produced by mferior zeal, [purity of]
consciousness, energy, or inquiry; the medium is produced by mediiun zeal, etc.;
the superior, by superior (zeal, and so on). That undertaken out of desire for fame is
inferior; that imdertaken out of desire for the fruits of merit is medium; that
imdertaken for the sake of the noble state thus, "This has to be done" is superior. Or
again, that defiled by self-praise and disparagement of others, etc, thus, "I am
possessed of virtue, but these other bhikkhus are ill-conducted and evil-nahired〃
(M1193), is inferior; imdefiled numdane virtue is medium; supianuindaiie is superior.
Or again, that motivated by craving, the purpose of which is to enjoy continued
existence, is inferior; that practiced for the piupose of one's own deliverance is
medium; the virtue of the perfections practiced for the deliverance of all beings is
superior. So it is of three kinds as inferior, medium, and superior.
34.	10. In the second triad that practiced out of self-regard by one who regards self
and desires to abandon what is imbecoroing to self [14] is vii tue giving precedence to
self. That practiced out of regard for the world and out of desire to ward off the censm e
of the world is vii tue gizmig precedence to the world. That practiced out of regard for the
Dhamma and out of desire to honoiu the majesty of the Dhamma is viitue giving
precedence to the Dlinmma. So it is of three kinds as giving precedence to self, and so on.
35.	11. In the third triad the virtue that in the dyads was called dependent (no. 5)
is adhered-to because it is adhered-to through craving and [false] view. That practiced
by the magnanimous ordiiiaiy man as the prerequisite of the path, and that
associated with the path in trainers, are not-adhered-to. That associated with tramers'
and non-tramers" fruition is trnnqtiillized. So it is of three kinds as adhered-to, and
so on.
36.	12. In the fourth triad that fulfilled by one who has committed no offence or
has made amends after committing one is pure. So long as he has not made amends
after committing an offence it is impure. Virtue in one who is dubious about whether
a tiling constitutes an offence or about what grade of offence has been committed
or about whether he has committed an offence is dubious. Herein, the meditator
should purify impure viitue. If dubious, he should avoid cases about which he is
doubtful and should get his doubts cleared up. In this way his mind will be kept at
rest. So it is of three kinds as pure, and so on.
37.	13. In the fifth triad the virtue associated with the four paths and with the
[first] three fruitions is that of the trainer. That associated with the fruition of
Arahantship is that of the noii-traiiieK The l'emaining kinds are that of the neither-
trainer-nor-non-trainer. So it is of three kinds as that of the trainer, and so on.
38.	But in. tlie world tlie natiue of such and such beings is called theii "habit" {slla) of
which they say: "This one is of happy habit (stiklui-slla), this one is of Luiltappy habit,
this one is of quairelsome habit, this one is of dandified habit." Because of that it is
said iii the Patisainbliida figiuatively: "Three kiiuis of virtue (habit): profitable virtue,
improfitable viitue, indeterminate virtue" (Patis 144). So it is also called of three kiiuis
as profitable, and so on. Of these, the iQiprofitable is not included here since it has
nothing whatever to do with the headings beginning with the chaiacteristic, which
define viitue in the sense intended in this [chapter]. So the threefoldness should be
understood onlv in the way already stated.
39. 14. In the first of the tetrads:
The luwirtuous he cultivates,
He visits not the virtuous,
And iii his ignorance he sees
No fault iii a transgression here, [15]
With wrong thoughts often in his mind
His faculties he will not guard—
Virtue in such a constitution
Comes to partake ofdimitmtion.
But he whose mind is satisfied.
With virtue that has been achieved,
Who never thinks to stir himself
And take a meditation subject up,
Contented with mere vii tiiousness,
Nor striving for a higher state—
His vii tue bears the appellation
Of that partaking of stagnation.
But who, possessed of virtue, strives
With concentration for his aim~
`19
That bhikklui's virtue in its fiuiction
Is called partaking of distinction.
Who finds mere virtue not enough
But has dispassion for his goal—
His virtue through such aspiration
Comes to partake of penetration.
So it is of four kinds as partaking of diminution, and so on.
40.	15. In the second tetrad there are training precepts announced for bhikkhus to
keep irrespective of what is aimoimced for bhikkhimis. This is the virtue of bhikkhus.
There are tmining precepts amioimced for bhikkluiriis to keep iirespective of what is
announced for bhikkluis. This is the virtue of bhikkJiums. The ten precepts of vii tue for
male and female novices are the vii tue of the not fully admitted. The five training
precepts~ten when possibleas a permanent imdertakiiig and eight as the factors of
the Uposatha Day,10 for male and female lay followers are the vii tue of the laity. So it is
of four kiiuis as the vii tue of bliikklnis, and so on.
41.	26. In the third tetrad the non-transgression on the part of Uttarakuru human
beings is natural virtue. Each clan's or locality's or sect's own rules of conduct are
customary virtue. The virtue of the Bodhisatta's mother described thus: "It is the
necessary rule, Ananda, that when the Bodhisatta has descended into his mother's
womb, no thought of men that is connected with the cords of sense desire comes to
her" (DII13), is necessary virtue. But the virtue of such piue beings as Maha Kassapa,
etc., and of the Bodhisatta in his various births is virtue due to previous causes. So it
is of foiu' kinds as natural virtue, and so on.
42. 17. In the fourth tetrad:
(a)	The virtue described by the Blessed One thus: "Here a bhikkhu dwells
restramed with the Patimokklia restraint, possessed of the [proper] conduct and
resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, he trains himself by undertaking the
precepts of training, (Vibh 244)〃 is virtue of Patimokkha restraint.
(b)	That described thus: “On seeing a visible object with the eye, [16] he
apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left the eye
faculty unguarded, evil and improfitable states of covetousness and grief might
invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the eye faculty,
imdertakes the restiaiiit of the eye faculty. On hearing a sound with the ear ... On
smelling an odour with the nose ... On tasting a flavour with the tongue ... On
10. Uposatha (der. from upavasati, to observe or to prepare) is the name for the day of
"fasting" or "vigil" observed on the days of the new moon, waxing half moon, full
moon, and waning half moon. On these days it is customary for laymen to iindei take
the Eight Precepts (sila) or Five Precepts. On the new-moon and full-moon days the
Patimokklia (see note 11) is recited by bliikkhns. The two quai ter-moon days are called
the "eighth of the half moon." The Full-moon day is called the "fifteenth" (i.e. fifteen
days from the new moon) and is the last day of the lunar month. That of the new moon
is called the "fourteenth" when it is the second and fourth new moon of the foiu-
month season (i.e. foiuteen days from the full moon), the other two are called the
"fifteenth." This compensates for the irregiilarities of the liuiar period.
`20
touching a tangible object with the body ... On cognizing a mental object with the
mind, he apprehends neither the signs nor the particulars through which, if he left
the mind faculty imguarded, evil and improfitable states of covetousness and grief
might invade him; he enters upon the way of its restraint, he guards the mind
faculty undertakes the restraint of the mind faculty (M1180), is virtue of restraint of
the sense faculties.
(c)	Abstinence from such wrong livelihood as entails tiaiisgression of the six training
precepts announced with respect to livelihood and entails the evil states beginning
with "Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, piu siiiiig gain with gain" (MII75) is virtue
of livelihood purificntion.
(d)	Use of the four requisites that is piuified by the reflection stated in the way
beginning, "Reflecting wisely he uses the robe only for protection from cold" (MI
10) is called virtue concerning requisites.
43. Here is an explanatory exposition together with a word commentary starting
from the beginning.
(a) Here: in this dispensation. A bhikkhu: a clansman who has gone forth out of
faith and is so styled because he sees fear in the roimd of rebirths (smnsare bhmjmij
ikkJmiinta) or because he wears cloth garments that are torn and pieced together,
and so on.
Restrained with the Patimokkha restraint: here ^Patimokkha/r (Rule of the
Conuiumity)11 is the virtue of the training precepts; for it frees (mokkheti) him who
protects (ynti) it, guards it, it sets him free (mocnyati) from the pains of the states of
loss, etc., that is why it is called Pntimokkhn. "Restraint:" is restiamiiig; this is a term
for bodily and verbal non-transgression. The Patimokkha itself as restraint is
"Patimokkha restraint./r "Restrained with the Patimokkha iestiaint〃 is restramed
by means of the restraint consisting in that Patimokkha; he has it, possesses it, is
the meaning. Dwells: bears himself m one of the postures. [17]
44. The meaning of possessed of [the proper] conduct mid resort, etc., should be
luuierstood in the way in which it is given in the text. For this is said: "Possessed of
[the proper] conduct and resort: there is [proper] conduct and improper conduct.
Herein, what is improper conduct? Bodily transgression, verbal ticuisgression,
bodily and verbal transgression—this is called improper conduct. Also all
luwii'tuousness is improper conduct. Here someone makes a livelihood by gifts of
bamboos, or by gifts of leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and
tooth sticks, or by flattery 01 by bean-soupeiy or by fondling, or by going on errands
on foot, or by one or other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the
Buddhas—this is called improper conduct. Herein, what is [proper] conduct? Bodily
11. The Suttavibhaiiga, the first book of the Vinaya Pitaka, contains in its two parts
the 227 rules for bhikkhus and the rides for bltikklnuUs, who have received the admission
(upmsmnpadn), together with accoimts of the incidents that led to the aimotmcement of
the rules, the modification of the rules and the explanations of them. The bare rules
themselves form the Patimokkha for bhikkhus and that for bhikkhunis. They are also
known as the "two codes" (dve matika). The Patimokklia is recited by bhikkhus on the
Uposatha days of the full moon and new moon.
`21
non-traiisgression, verbal non-transgression, bodily and verbal non-traiisgression~
this is called [proper] conduct. Also all restramt through vii tue is [proper] conduct.
Here someone "does not make a livelihood by gifts of bamboos, or by gifts of
leaves, or by gifts of flowers, fruits, bathing powder, and tooth sticks, or by flattery,
or by bean-soupery, or by fondling, or by going on enands on foot, or by one 01
other of the sorts of wrong livelihood condemned by the Buddhas—this is called
[proper] conduct."
45. [Proper] resort: there is [proper] resort and improper resort. Herein, what is
improper resort? Here someone has prostitutes as resort, or he has widows, old
maids, eiunichs, bhikkhtinis, or taverns as resort; or he dwells associated with kings,
kings' ministers, sectarians, sectal,ians, disciples, in imbeconiiiig association with
laymen; or he cultivates, frequents, honours, such families as are faithless,
imtrustmg, abusive and rude, who wish harm, wish ill, wish woe, wish no stu cease
of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkhtinls, for male and female devotees [181—tliis
is called improper resort. Herein, what is [proper] resort? Here someone does not
have prostitutes as resort ...or taverns as resort; he does not dwell associated with
kings. • • sectarians' disciples, in unbecoming association with laymen; he cultivates,
frequents, honours, such families as are faithful and trusting, who are a solace,
where the yellow cloth glows, where the breeze of sages blows, who wish good,
wish well, wish joy wish surcease of bondage, for bhikkhus and bhikkluinis, for
male and female devotees—this is called [proper] resort. Thus he is furnished with,
fully fiuiiished with, provided with, fully provided with, supplied with, possessed
of, endowed with, this [proper] conduct and this [proper] resort. Hence it is said,
'Possessed of [the proper] conduct and resort"' (Vibh 24647).
46.	Furthermore, [proper] conduct and resort should also be understood here in
the iollowmg way; for improper conduct is twofold as bodily and verbal. Herein,
what is bodily improper conduct? "Here someone acts disrespectfully before the
Comnumity, and he stands jostling elder bhikkhus, sits jostling them, stands in
front of them, sits in front of them, sits on a high seat, sits with his head covered,
talks standing up, talks waving his aims ... walks with sandals while elder bhikkhus
walk without sandals, walks on a high walk while they walk on a low walk, walks
on a walk while they walk on the ground ... stands pushing elder bhikkhus, sits
pushing them, prevents new bhikkhus from getting a seat... and in the bath house
...without asking elder bhikkhus he puts wood on [the stove] ... bolts the door ...
and at the bathing place he enters the water jostling elder bhikkhus, enters it in
front of them, bathes jostling them, bathes in front of them, comes out jostling
them, comes out in front of them ... and entering inside a house he goes jostling
elder bhikkhus, goes in front of them, pushing foi'ward he goes in front of them ...
and where families have inner private screened rooms in which the women of the
family ... the girls of the family sit, there he enters abruptly and he strokes a
chilcTs head" (Nidd I 228-29). This is called bodily improper conduct.
47.	Herein, what is verbal improper conduct? "Here someone acts disrespectfully
before the Conmuuiity. Without asking elder bhikkhus he talks on the Dhamma,
answers questions, recites the Patiinokklia, talks standing up, [19] talks waving his
aims ... having entered inside a house, he speaks to a woman or a girl thus: 'You, so-
`22
and-so of such-and-such a dan, what is there? Is there rice gruel? Is there cooked lice?
Is there any hard food to eat? What shall we drink? What hard food shall we eat? What
soft food shall we eat? Or what will you give me?'~he chatters like this" (Nidd 1230).
This is called verbal improper conduct.
48.	Proper conduct should be understood in the opposite sense to that.
Furthermore, a bhikkhu is respectful, deferential, possessed of conscience and
shame, wears his inner robe properly, wears his upper robe properly, his maimer
inspires confidence whether in moving forwai.ds or backwards, looking ahead or
aside, bending or stretching, his eyes are downcast, he has (a good) deportment,
he guards the doors of his sense facilities, knows the right measure in eating, is
devoted to wakefulness, possesses mindfulness and full awareness, wants little, is
contented, is strenuous, is a careful observer of good behaviour, and treats the
teachers with great respect. This is called (proper) conduct.
This firstly is how (proper) conduct should be imderstood.
49.	(Proper) resort is of three kinds: (proper) resort as support, (proper) resort as
guarding, and (proper) resort as anchoring. Herein, what is (proper) resort as
support? A good friend who exhibits the instances of talk,12 in whose presence one
hears what has not been heard, corrects what has been heard, gets rid of doubt,
rectifies one's view, and gains confidence; or by training tmder whom one grows
in faith, vii tue, learning, generosity and imderstaiuimg—this is called (proper) resort
as support.
50.	What is (proper) resort as guarding? Here "A bhikkhu, having entered inside
a house, having gone into a street, goes with downcast eyes, seeing the length of a
plough yoke, restrained, not looking at an elephant, not looking at a hoi.se, a carriage,
a pedestrian, a woman, a man, not looking up, not looking down, not staring this
way and that" (Nidd 1474). This is called (proper) resort as guarding.
51.	What is (proper) resort as aiichormg? It is the four foundations of mindfulness
on which the mind is anchored; for this is said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus,
what is a bliikkhu's resort, his own native place? It is these four foimdations of
mindfulness" (S V 148). This is called (proper) resort as anchoring.
Being thus furnished with ... endowed with, this (proper) conduct and this
(proper) resort, he is also on that account called "one possessed of (proper) conduct
and resort/' [201
52.	Seeing fear in the slightest fault (§42): one who has the habit (slla) of seeing tear
in faults of the minutest measiue, of such kinds as unintentional contraveiung ot a
minor training rule of the Patimokklia, or the arising of improfitable thoughts. He
trains himself by undertaking (samadaya) the precepts of trnining: whatever there is
among the precepts of training to be trained in, in all that he trains by taking it up
12. The "ten instances of talk" (dasa kathavattlnlni) refer to the kinds of talk given in
the Suttas thus: "Such talk as is concerned with effacement, as favoius the heart's release,
as leads to complete dispassion, fading, cessation, peace, direct knowledge,
enlightenment, Nibbana, that is to say: talk on wanting little, contentment, seclusion,
aloofness from contact, strenuousness, viitue, concentration, understanding,
deliverance, knowledge and vision of deliveiance" (M1145; III 113).
`22
rightly (smnrna adnyn). And here, as far as the words, "one restrained by the
Patimokkha restraint// virtue of Patimokklia restraint is shown by discourse in
terms of persons.13 But all that beginning with the words, "possessed of [proper]
conduct and i’esort〃 should be understood as said in order to show the way of
practice that perfects that vii tue in him who so practices it.
53.	(b) Now, as regards the vii tue of restraint of faculties shown next to that in the
way beginning, "on seeing a visible object with the eye/7 herein he is a bhikkhu
established in the virtue of Patimokklia restiaiiit. On seeing a visible object with the eye:
on seeing a visible object with the eye-coi'isciousness that is capable of seeing visible
objects and has borrowed the name "eye" from its iiistnunent. But the Ancients {porana)
said: "The eye does not see a visible object because it has no niiiui. The niiiui does not
see because it has no eyes. But when there is the iinpmgement of door and object he
sees by means of the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its physical basis. No\^
(an idiom) such as this is called an 'accessory locution/ (sasamblmrakatlia), like 'He shot
him with his bow^ and so on. So the meaning here is this: 'On seeing a visible object
with eye-conscioiisness/〃14
54.	Apprehends neither the signs: he does not apprehend the sign of woman or
man, or any sign that is a basis for defilement such as the sign of beaut》etc.; he
stops at what is merely seen. Nor the particulars: he does not apprehend any aspect
classed as hand, foot, smile, laughter, talk, looking ahead, looking aside, etc., which
has acquired the name "particular" (nmibyanjana) because of its paiticulaiiziiig
(mm miu b}jm~ijminto) defilements, because of its making them manifest themselves.
13.	See Ch. IV n. 27.
14.	u,On seeing a visible object with the e\jen\ if the eye were to see the visible object, then
(organs) belonging to other kinds of consciousness would see too; but that is not so.
Why? Because the eye has no thought (acetanatta). And then, were consciousness itself
to see a visible object, it would see it even behind a wall because of being independent
of sense resistance (appatighabhavato); but that is not so either because there is no seeing
iii all kinds of consciousness. And herein, it is consciousness dependent on the eye that
sees, not just any kind. And that does not arise with respect to what is enclosed by
walls, etc., where light is excluded. But where there is no exclusion of light, as in the
case of a crystal or a mass of cloud, there it does arise even with respect to what is
enclosed by them. So it is as a basis of consciousness that the eye sees.
"'When there is the impingement of door and object': what is intended is: when a visible
datum as object has come into the eye's focus. 'One sees': one looks (oloketi); for when
the consciousness that has eye-sensitivity as its material support is disclosing (obhasente)
by means of the special quality of its support a visible datiun as object that is assisted
by light (aloka), then it is said that a person possessed of that sees the visible datiun.
Aiuihere the ilkuninating is the revealing of the visible datiun according to its individual
essence, in other words, the apprehending of it experientially (paccakkhato).
"Here it is the 'sign of woman' because it is the cause of perceiving as 'woman' all
such things as the shape that is grasped imder the heading of the visible data
(materiality) invariably foiuid in a female continuity, the un-clear-cut-ness (avisadata)
of the flesh of the breasts, the beaidlessness of the face, the use of cloth to bind the hair,
the im-clear-ciit stance, walk, and so on. The 'sign of man, is in the opposite sense.

He only apprehends what is really there. Like the Elder Maha Tissa who dwelt at
Cetiyapabbata.
55. It seems that as the elder was on his way from Cetiyapabbata to Aiuu adhapiua
for alms, a certain danghteriiilaw of a clan, who had quarrelled with her husbaiui
and had set out early from Aiuuadhapiua all dressed up and tricked out like a
celestial nymph to go to her relatives' home, saw him on the road, and being low-
minded, [21] she laughed a loud laugh. [Wondeiing] "What is that?" the elder
looked up and finding in the bones of her teeth the perception of foulness (ugliness),
he reached Araliantsliip.15 Hence it was said:
"He saw the bones that were her teeth,
And kept in mind his first perception;
And standing on that very spot
The elder became an Amhant."
But her husband, who was going after her, saw the elder and asked, "Venerable
sir, did you by any chance see a woman?" The elder told him:
"Whether it was a man 01 woman
That went by I noticed not,
'"The sign of beaiity' here is the aspect of woman that is the cause for the arising of
lust. By the word 'etc/ the sign of resentment (patigha), etc., are included, which should
be imderstood as the imdesired aspect that is the cause for the arising of hate. And
here admittedly only covetousness and grief are specified in the text but the sign of
equaiiiiiiity needs to be included too; since there is non-restraiiit in the delusion that
arises due to overlooking, or since 'forgetfulness of Llnknowing, is said below (§57).
And here the 'sign of eqnai'iiimty/ should be imderstood as an object that is the basis
for the kind of equanimity associated with luikiiowing through overlooking it. So 'the
sign of beauty, etc/ given in brief thus is actually the cause of greed, hate, and delusion.
“*He stops at zuhat is merely seen': according to the Sutta method, The seen shall be
merely seen' (Ud 8). As soon as the colour basis has been apprehended by the
consciousnesses of the cognitive series with eye-consciousness he stops; he does not
fancy any aspect of beauty, etc., beyond that.…In one who fancies as beautiful, etc., the
limbs of the opposite sex, defilements arisen with respect to them successively become
particularized, which is why they are called 'particulars/ But these are simply modes
of mterpretiiig (sannivesakara) the kinds oi: inateiiality derived from the (four) priinaiies
that are interpreted (sannivittha) in such and such wise; for apart from that there is in
the ultimate sense no such thing as a hand and so on〃 (Vism-nilit 40-41). See also Ch.
HI, note 31.
15. "As the elder was going along (occupied) only in keeping his meditation subject
iii niind, since noise is a thorn to those in the early stage, he looked up with the noise of
the laughter, (wondering) 'What is that?7 'Perception of foidness/ is perception of bones;
for the elder was then making bones his meditation subject. The elder, it seenis as soon
as he saw her teeth-bones while she was laughing, got the coimterpart sign with access
jhaiia because he had developed the pieliiiiiiiaiy-work well. While he stood there he
reached the first jhaiia. Then he made that the basis for insight, which he augmented
imtil he attained the paths one after the other and reached destruction of cankers"
(Vism-nilit 41 一42).

But only that on this high road
There goes a group of bones/'
56.	As to the words tJiroitgli which, etc., the meaning is: by reason of which, because
of which non-restraiiit of the eye faculty if he, if that person, left the eye faculty
unguarded, remained with the eye door unclosed by the door-panel of mindfulness,
these states of covetousness, etc., might invnde, might pursue, might threaten, him. He
enters upon the way of its restraint: he enters upon the way of closing that eye faculty
by the door-paiiel of mindfulness. It is the same one of whom it is said he guards the
eye faculty, undertakes the restraint of the eye fnaihy.
57.	Herein, there is neither restraint nor non-reshaiiit in the actual eye faculty
since neither mindfulness nor forgetfulness arises in dependence on eye-sensitivity.
On the contrary when a visible datum as object comes into the eye's focus, then,
after the life-contiiuiiun has arisen twice and ceased, the functional mind-element
accomplishing the function of adverting arises and ceases. After that, eye-
consciousness with the function of seeing; after that, resultant mind-element with
the function of receiving; after that, resultant root-causeless niiiid-consciousness-
element with the fiuiction of investigating; after that, functional root-causeless
niiiid-coi'isciousness-element accomplishing the fimction of deteimining arises and
ceases. Next to that, impulsion impels.16 Herein, there is neither restramt nor non-
restramt on the occasion of the life-contiiuuun, or on any of the occasions beginning
with adverting. But there is non-restramt if luwirtuousness 01 forgetfuhiess or
imkiiowmg or impatience or idleness arises at the moment of impulsion. When
this happens, it is called "'non-restraint in the eye faculty/' [22]_
58. Why is that? Because when tliis happens, the door is not guarded, nor are the
life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the cognitive series. Like what? Just as, when
a city's foiu. gates are not seciued, although inside the city house doors, storehouses,
rooms, etc., are seciued, yet all property inside the city is imguai ded and luiprotected
since robbers coming in by the city gates can do as they please, so too, when
luwii tuoiisness, etc., arise in impulsion in which there is no i.estmint, then the door too
is unguarded, and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the
cognitive series beginning with adverting. But when virtue, etc., has arisen in it, then
the door too is guarded and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of
16. To expect to find in the Parmnntthatnanjilsn an exposition of the "cognitive series"
(citta-vithi), and some explanation of the individual members in addition to what is to
be foimd in the Visuddhimagga itself, is to be disappointed. There are only fragmentaiy
treatments. All that is said here is this:
"There is no luwirtuousness, in other words, bodily 01 verbal misconduct, in the
five doors; consequently restraint of tinvirtuousness happens through the inind door,
and the remaining restraint happens through the six doors. For the arising of
forgetfulness and the other three would be in the five doors since they are improfitable
states opposed to niindhilness, etc.; and there is no arising of tinvii tuousness consisting
iii bodily and verbal transgression there because five-door impulsions do not give rise
to intimation. And the five kinds of non-iestiaiiit beginning with luwirtuousness are
stated here as the opposite of the five kinds of restraint beginning with restraint as
vii tue" (Vism-mht 42). See also Ch. iy note 13.
`25
the cognitive series beginning with adverting. Like what? Just as, when the city gates
are seciued, although inside the city the houses, etc., are not secured, yet all properly
inside the city is well guarded, well protected, since when the city gates are shut there
is no ingress for robbers, so too, when virtue, etc., have arisen in impulsion, the door
too is guarded and so also are the life-contiiuuun and the consciousnesses of the
cognitive series beginning with adverting. Tluis although it actually arises at the moment
of impulsion, it is nevertheless called "lestmint in the eye facility"
59.	So also as regards the phrases oil hearing a soiuid with the ear and so on. So it is
this virtue, which in brief has the characteristic of avoiding apprehension ot signs
entailing defilement with respect to visible objects, etc., that should be imderstood
as virtue of restraint of faculties.
60.	(c) Now, as regards the virtue of livelihood piuification mentioned above next
to the viitue of restramt of the faculties (§42), the words of the six precepts announced
on account of livelihood mean, of the following six trammg precepts amtoimced thus:
"With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, one of evil wishes, a prey to
wishes, lays claim to a higher than human state that is non-existent, not a fact," the
contravention of which is defeat (expulsion from the Order); "with livelihood as
cause, with livelihood as reason, he acts as go-between, the contravention of which
is an offence entailing a meeting of the Order; "with livelihood as cause, with
livelihood as reason, he says, yA bhikkhu who lives in your monastery is an
Aiahant,'" the contravention of which is a serious offence in one who is aware of it;
"with livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason, a bhikkhu who is not sick eats
superior food that he has ordered for his own use," the contravention of which is
an offence reqiiiiiiig expiation: "With livelihood as cause, with livelihood as reason,
a bhikkhitnl who is not sick eats superior food that she has ordered for her own
use," the contravention of which is an offence reqiiiriiig confession; "with livelihood
as cause, with livelihood as reason, one who is not sick eats curry 01 boiled rice
[23] that he has ordered for his own use/' the contravention of which is an offence
of wi.ongdoing (Vin V 146). Of these six precepts.17
61.	As regards schemiug, etc. (§42), this is the text: "Herein, what is scheming? It
is the grimacing, grimaceiy scheming, schemery, schemedness,18 by what is called
rejection of requisites or by indirect talk, or it is the disposing, posing, composing,
of the deportment on the part of one bent on gain, honoiu' and renown, of one of
evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called scheming.
62.	"Herein, what is talking? Talking at others, talking, talking roimd, talking tip,
continual talking up, persuading, continual persuading, suggesting, continual
suggesting, ingratiating chatter, llatteiy bean-soapery, fondling, on the part of one
bent on gain, honoiu. and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is
called talking.
17.	This apparently incomplete sentence is also in the Pali text. It is not clear why
(BPS Ed.)
18.	The formula "kuhana kiihax/ana kuhitnttmii," i.e. verbal noun in two forms and
abstract noirn from pp., all from the same root, is conunon in Abliidliaimna definitions.
It is sometimes hard to produce a corresponding effect in English, yet to render such
groups with words of different derivation obscures the meaning and confuses the effect.
`26
63.	"Herein, what is hinting? A sign to others, giving a sign, indication, giving
indication, indirect talk, roiuidabout talk, on the part of one bent on gain, honour
and renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called hinting.
64.	"Herein, what is belittling? Abusing of others, disparaging, reproachmg,
snubbing, continual snubbing, ridicule, continual ridicule, deiiigration, continual
demgration, tale-bearmg, backbiting, on the part of one bent on gain, honour and
renown, of one of evil wishes, a prey to wishes—this is called belittling.
65.	^Herein, what is piu siiiiig gain with gain? Seeking, seeking foi> seeking out, going
iii search of, searching for, searching out material goods by means of material goods,
such as carrying there goods that have been got from here, or carrying here goods that
have been got from there, by one bent on gain, honotu' and renown, by one of evil
wishes, a prey to wishes一this is called piusiiiiig gain with gain."19 (Vibh 352-53)
66.	The meaning of this text should be imderstood as follows: Firstly as regards
description of scheming: on the part of one bent on gain, honour mid renown is on the
part of one who is bent on gain, on honoiu*, and on reputation; on the part of one
who longs for them, is the meaning. [24] Of one of evil wishes: of one who wants to
show qualities that he has not got. A prey to wishes:20 the meaning is, of one who is
attacked by them. And after this the passage beginning or by zvJmt is called rejection
of requisites is given in order to show the three instances of scheming given in the
Maliaiiiddesa as rejection of requisites, indirect talk, and that based on deportment.
67.	Herein, [a bhikkhu] is invited to accept robes, etc., and, precisely because he
wants them, he refuses them out of evil wishes. And then, since he knows that
those householders believe in him implicitly when they think, "Oil, how lew are
our lord's wishes! He will not accept a thing!" and they put fine robes, etc., before
him by various means, he then accepts, making a show that he wants to be
compassionate towards them—it is this hypocrisy of his, which becomes the cause
of their subsequently bringing them even by cartloads, that should be imderstood
as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites.
68. For this is said in the Mahaiiiddesa: "What is the instance of scheming called
rejection of requisites? Here householders invite bhikkhus [to accept] robes, alms
food, resting place, and the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick. One who is ot
evil wishes, a prey to wishes, wanting robes ... alms food ... resting place ... the
requisite of medicine as cine for the sick, refuses robes ... alms food ... resting
place ... the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick, because he wants more. He
says: 'What has an ascetic to do with expensive robes? It is proper for an ascetic to
gather rags from a charnel ground or from a rubbish heap or from a shop and
make them into a patchwork cloak to wear. What has an ascetic to do with expensive
19. The rendeimgs "scheming" and so on in this context do not in all cases agree
with PED. They have been chosen after careful consideration. The rendering "rejection
of requisites^ takes the preferable reading patisedhmui though the more conmion reading
here is patisevana (cultivation).
20 The Pali is: “kci卿dkatnssn ti icchai/a apjakntassa; upaddutassa ti attho." Icchaya apakatassa
simply resolves the compound icchapjakatassa and is therefore untranslatable into
English. Such resolutions are therefore sometimes omitted in this translation.
`27
alms food? It is proper for an ascetic to get his living by the dropping of liunps [of
food into his bowl] while he wanders for gleanings. What has an ascetic to do with
an expensive resting place? It is proper for an ascetic to be a tree-root-dweller or an
open-aii-dweller. What has an ascetic to do with an expensive requisite of medicine
as ciue for the sick? It is proper for an ascetic to cure himself with putrid ui.ine21
and broken galliuits/ Accordingly he wears a coarse robe, eats coarse aims food,
[25] uses a coarse resting place, uses a coarse requisite of medicine as cure for the
sick. Then householders think, 'This ascetic has few wishes, is content, is secluded,
keeps aloof from company, is strenuous, is a preacher of asceticism/ and they invite
him more and more [to accept) robes, alms food, resting places, and the requisite
of medicine as ciue for the sick. He says: 'With three things present a faithful
clansman produces much merit: with faith present a faithful clansman produces
much merit, with goods to be given present a faithful clansman produces much
merit, with those worthy to receive present a faithful clansman produces much
merit. You have faith; the goods to be given are here; and I am here to accept. If I
do not accept, then you will be deprived of the merit. That is no good to me. Rather
will I accept out of compassion for you/7 Accordingly he accepts many robes, he
accepts much alms food, he accepts many resting places, he accepts many requisites
of medicine as cure for the sick. Such grimacing, griinaceiy, scheming, schemery,
schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming called rejection of requisites'
(Nidd 1224-25).
69. It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, who gives it to be imderstood
verbally in some way or other that he has attained a higher than human state, that
should be understood as the instance of scheming called indirect talk, according
as it is said: "What is the instance of scheming called iiidirect talk? Here someone
of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to be admired, ftliii'ikmg] Thus people will
admire me, speaks words about the noble state. He says, 'He who wears such a
robe is a very important ascetic/ He says, yHe who carries such a bowl, metal cup,
water filler, water strainer, keyf wears such a waist band, sandals, is a very important
ascetic/ He says, 'He who has such a preceptor ... teacher ... who has the same
preceptor, who has the same teacher, who has such a friend, associate, intimate,
companion; he who lives in such a monastery, lean-to, mansion, villa,22 cave, grotto,
hut, pavilion, watch tower, hall, bam, meeting hall, [26] room, at such a tree root, is
a very iinpoi tant ascetic/ Or alternatively, all-gushing, all-griinacing, all-scheniiiig,
all-talkative, with an expression of adimration, he utters such deep, mysterious,
cunning, obscure, supranumdane talk suggestive of voidness as Tliis ascetic is an
obtaiiier of peaceful abidings and attainments such as these/ Such grimacing,
griinaceiy scheming, schemery, schemedness, is known as the instance of scheming
called indirect talk" (Nidd 1226-27).
70. It is hypocrisy on the part of one of evil wishes, which takes the form of deportment
influenced by eagerness to be admired, that: should be imderstood as the instance of
21	"'Putrid urine, is the name for all kinds of cow's urine whether old or not" (Vism-
nilit 45). Fermented cow's uiine with gallnuts (inyiobalan) is a conmion Indian medicine
today.
22	It is not always certain now what kind of buildings these names refer to.
`28
scheming dependent on deportment, according as it is said: "What is the instance of
scheming called deportment? Here someone of evil wishes, a prey to wishes, eager to
be admired, [thinking] 'Thus people will admire me, composes his way of walking,
composes his way of lying down; he walks studiedly stands studiedly sits studiedly
lies down studiedly； he walks as though concentrated, stands, sits, lies down as though
concentrated; and he is one who meditates in public. Such disposing, posing,
composing, of deportment, grimacing, griinaceiy scheming, schemer^ schemedness,
is known as the instance of scheming called deportment" (Nidd 1225-26).
71.	Herein, the words by what is called rejection of requisites (§61) mean: by what is
called thus "rejection of requisites"; or they mean: by means of the rejection ot
requisites that is so called. By indirect talk means: by talking near to the subject. Of
deportment means: of the four modes of deportment (postures). Disposing is initial
posing, or careful posing. Posing is the manner of posing. Composing is preaiiaiigmg;
assiuning a tmst-mspirmg attitude, is what is meant. Grimacing is making grimaces
by showing great intenseness; facial contraction is what is meant. One who has the
habit of making grimaces is a griinacer. The griinacer's state is grimacery. Schetniiig
is hypocrisy. The way (aymia) of a schemer (kuJin) is schemery (kuhnynnn). The state
of what is schemed is schemedness.
72.	In the description of talking: talking at is talking thus on seeing people coming
to the monastery "What have you come for, good people? What, to invite bhikkhus?
If it is that, then go along and I shall come later with fmy bowl]/' etc.; or alternatively,
talking at is talking by advertising oneself thus, "I am Tissa, the king trusts me,
such and such king's ministers trust me/r [271 Talking is the same kind of talking
by extolling people thus, "He is a great land-owner, a great ship-ownei, a great
lord of giving." Contiiiunl talking up is talking by extolling [people] in all ways.
73.	Persiiadiug is progressively involving23 [people] thus, "Lay followers, formerly you
used to give tirst-fi’iiit alms at such a time; why do you not do so now?" imtil they say
"We shall give, venerable sir, we have had no opportunity" etc.; entangling, is what is
meant. Or alternatively seeing someone with sugarcane in his hand, he asks, "Where
are you coming from, lay follower?"—"From the sugarcane field, venerable sir"—"Is
the sugarcane sweet there?"—"One can find out by eating, venerable sir"—"It is not
allowed, lay follower, for bhikkhus to say 7Give [me some] sugarcane/" Such entangling
talk from such an entaiigler is persuading. Peisuadiiig again and again in all ways is
continual persuading.
74.	Suggesting is insiiiuatmg by specifying thus, "That family alone understands
me; if there is anything to be given there, they give it to me only"; pointing to, is
what is meant. And here the story of the oil-seller should be told.24 Suggesting in
all ways again and again is continual suggesting.
23	Naluma—tying, from nayhati (to tie). The noiui in not in PED.
24	The story of the oil-seller is given in the SammohavinodanJ (Vibh-a 483), which
reproduces this part of Vism with some additions: "Two bhikkhus, it seems, went into
a village and sat down in the sitting hall. Seeing a girl, they called her. Then one asked
`29
75.	Ijigrntintiiig chatter is endearing chatter repeated again and again without
regard to whether it is in conformity with truth and Dhanuna. Flattery is speaking
humbly always maintaining an attitude of inferiority. Bean-sotiyery is resemblance
to bean soup; for just as when beans are being cooked only a few do not get cooked,
the rest get cooked, so too the person in whose speech only a little is true, the rest
being false, is called a "bean soup"; his state is bemi-soiipery.
76.	Fondling is the state of the act of fondling. [28] For when a man fondles cliildren
on his lap or on his shoulder like a nurse~he nurses, is the meaning—that fondler's
act is the act of fondling. The state of the act of fondling is fondling.
77.	In the description of hintuig (nemittikaia): a sign (nimiiia) is any bodily or
verbal act that gets others to give requisites. Giving a sign is making a sign such as
"What have you got to eat?", etc., on seeing [people] going along with food.
Indication is talk that alludes to requisites. Giving indication: on seeing cowboys, he
asks, "Are these milk cows' calves or buttermilk cows' calves?" and when it is said,
'They are milk cows' calves, venerable sir," [he remaiks] "They are not milk cows'
calves. If they were milk cows' calves the bhikkhus would be getting milk," etc.;
and his getting it to the knowledge of the boys' parents in this wa^ and so making
them give milk, is giving indication.
78.	Indirect talk is talk that keeps near [to the subject]. And here there should be told
the story of the bhikkhu supported by a family A bhikkhu, it seenis, who was supported
by a family went into the house wanting to eat and sat down. The mistress of the house
was luiwillii'ig to give. On seeing him she said, "There is no rice/' and she went to a
neighbour's house as though to get rice. The bhikkhu went into the storeroom. Looking
roimd, he saw sugarcane in the corner behind the door, sugar in a bowl, a siring of salt
fish iii a basket, rice in a jar, and ghee in a pot. He came out and sat down. When the
housewife came back, she said, "I did not get any rice." The bhikkhu said, "Lay follower,
I saw a sign just now that alms will not be easy to get today—"What, venerable sir?"——
"I saw a snake that was like sugarcane put in the corner behind the door; looking for
something to hit it with, I saw a stone like a liunp of sugar in a bowl. When the snake
had been hit with the clod, it spread out a hood like a string of salt fish in a basket, and
its teeth as it tried to bite the clod were like rice grains in a jar. Then the saliva mixed
with poison that came out to its moutli in its fiuy was like ghee put in a pot.〃 She thought,
'"There is no hoodwinking the shaveling/' so she gave him the sugarcane [29] and she
cooked the lice and gave it all to him with the ghee, the sugar and the fish.
79.	Such talk that keeps near fto the subject] should be understood as indirect talk.
Roiuidabout talk is talking round and roimd [the subject] as much as is allowed.
80.	In the description of belittling: abusing is abusing by means of the ten instances
of abuse.25 Disparaging is contemptuous talk. Reproaching is eniuneration of faults
such as "He is faithless, he is an tinbeliever. Snubbing is taking tip verbally thus,
the other,, Whose girl is this, venerable sir?'—'She is the daughter of om supporter the oil-
seller, Mend. When we go to her mother's house and she gives us ghee, she gives it in the
pot. And this girl too gives it in the pot as her mother does/" Quoted at Vism-nilit 46.
25. The "ten instances of abuse" (akkosa-vatthu) are given in the Saminohavinodam (Vibh-
a 340) as: "You are a thief, you are a fool, you are an idiot, you are a camel (ottha),
`30
"Don't say that here/' Snubbing in all ways, giving grotuuis and reasons, is coutiminl
snubbing. Or alternatively, when someone does not give, taking him up thus, "Oh,
the prince of givers!" is stubbing; and the thorough snubbing thus, "A niightyprmce
of givei’s!〃 is continual snubbing. Ridicule is making fun of someone thus, "What:
sort of a life has this mail who eats up his seed [grain]?" Contimial ridicule is making
fim of him more thoroughly thus, "What, you say this man is not a giver who
always gives the words There is nothing, to everyone?^
81.	Denigration26 is denigrating someone by saying that he is not a giver, or by censuring
him. All-roimd denigrntion is contimial denigrntion. Tale-bearing is bearing tales from
house to house, from village to village, from district to district, [thinking] "So they
will give to me out of fear of my bearing tales." Backbiting is speaking censoriously
behind anotlier's back after speaking kindly to his face; for this is like biting the
flesh of another's back, when he is not looking, on the part of one who is unable to
look him in the face; therefore it is called backbiting. This is called belittlitig
(nippesikatn) because it scrapes off (nippeseti), wipes off, the virtuous qualities of
others as a bamboo scraper (veltipesika) does imgaent, or because it is a pursuit of
gain by grinding (nippiinsitvn) and pulveiizing others' virtuous qualities, like the
pursuit of perfiune by grinding perfumed substances; that is why it is called
belittling.
82.	In the description of pursuing gain with gain: pursuing is hunting after. Got
from here is got from this house. There is into that house. Seeking is wanting. Seeking
for is himtiiig after. Seeking out is hiuitiiig after again and again. [30] The story of
the bhikkhu who went roiuid giving away the alms he had got at first to children
the bhikkhu who went roiuid giving away the alms he had got at first to children
of families here and there and in the end got milk and gruel should be told here.
Searching, etc., are synonyms for "seeking," etc., and so the coiistruction here should
be imderstood thus: going in search ofis seeking; searching for is seeking for; searching
out is seeking out.
This is the meaning of scheming, and so on.
83. Now, [as regards the words] The evil states beginning with (§42): here the words
beginning with should be imderstood to include the many evil states given in the
Bmlnnajala Sutta in the way beginning, "Or just as some worthy ascetics, while
eating the food given by the faithful, make a living by wrong livelihood, by such
low arts as these, that is to say, by palmistiy by fortime-tellmg, by divining omens,
by interpreting dreams, marks on the body holes gnawed by mice; by fiie sacrifice,
by spoon oblation •••" (D19).
you are an ox, you are a donkey you belong to the states of loss, you belong to hell, you
are a beast, there is not even a happy or an unhappy destiny to be expected for you〃
(see also Sn-a 364).
26. The following words of this paragraph are not in PED: Papmna (denigration),
pmpjanam (nt. denigrating), nippeseti (scrapes off—from pimsati? cf. nippesikatn—
"belittling" §§42,64), nippunchati (wipes off~only pwlcliati in PED), pesikn (scraper~not
iii this sense in PED: from same root as nippeseti), nippimsitva (giinding, pounding),
abbhanga (imguent = abbhaiijana, Vism-nilit 47).
`31
84.	So this wrong livelihood entails the transgression of these six tramiiig precepts
announced on accoimt of livelihood, and it entails the evil states beginning with
"Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain." And so it is the
abstinence from all sorts of wrong livelihood that is virtue of livelihood purification,
the word-meaiiiiig of which is this: on account of it they live, thus it is livelihood.
What is that? It is the effort consisting in the search for requisites. "Purification" is
piuifiedness. "livelihood purification" is purification of livelihood.
85.	(d) As regards the next kind called virtue concerning requisites, [here is the
text: “Reflecting wisely, he uses the robe only for protection from cold, for protection
from heat, for protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, burning and
creeping things, and only for the piupose of concealing the private parts. Reflecting
wisely, he uses alms food neither for amusement nor for intoxication nor for
smartening nor for embellishment, Lxit only for the endurance and contiiuiance of
this body for the ending of discomfort, and for assisting the life of purity: 'Thus I
shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse new feelings, and I shall be
healthy and blameless and live in comfort/ Reflecting wisely he uses the resting
place only for the purpose of protection from cold, for protection from heat, for
protection from contact with gadflies, flies, wind, biuniiig and creeping things,
and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate and enjoying retreat.
Reflecting wisely, he uses the requisite of medicine as cure for the sick only for
protection from arisen hurtful feelings and for complete iinnuinity from affliction"
(M I 10). Herein, reflecting zuisely is reflecting as the means and as the way;27 by
knowing, by reviewing, is the meaning. And here it is the reviewing stated in the
way beginning, "Foi protection from cold" that should be Liiiderstood as ^reflecting
wisely,
86.	Herein, the robe is any one of those beginning with the inner cloth. He uses: he
employs; dresses in [as inner cloth], or puts on [as upper garment]. Only [31] is a
phrase signifying invariability in the definition of a liniit28 of a purpose; the pmpose
in the meditator's making use of the robes is that much only, namely, protection
from cold, etc., not more than that. From cold: from any kind of cold arisen either
through disturbance of elements internally or through change in temperatiue
externally. For protection: for the purpose of warding off; for the purpose of
eliminating it so that it may not arouse affliction in the body. For when the body is
afflicted by cold, the distracted mind cannot be wisely exerted. That is why the
Blessed One permitted the robe to be used for protection from cold. So in each
instance, except that from Jient means from the heat of fire, the origin of which
should be imderstood as forest fires, and so on.
87.	From contact with gadflies mid flies, wind and burning mid creeping things: here
gadflies are flies that bite; they are also called "blind flies." Flies are just flies. Wind
is distinguished as that with dust and that without dust. Bimiiiig is burning of the
sun. Creeping things are any long creatines such as snakes and so on that move by
crawling. Contact with them is of two kinds: contact by being bitten and contact
27.	For attention (manasi-kara) as the means (upmya) and the way (pmtha) see M-a 164.
28.	Azmdhi—"limit" = odhi: this form is not in PED (see M-a II292).
`32
by being touched. And that does not worry him who sits with a robe on. So he uses
it for the purpose of protection from such tilings.
88.	O///1/: the word is repeated in order to define a subdivision of the invariable
purpose; for the concealment of the private parts is an invariable purpose; the
others are purposes periodically. Herein, private parts are any parts of the
pudendum. For when a member is disclosed, conscience (hiri) is disturbed
(kuppati)f offended. It is called /yprivate parts" (ItirikopJna) because of the
disturbance of conscience (hiri-kopmta). For the purpose of concealing the private
parts: for the purpose of the concealment of those private parts. [As well as the
reading ^hiriko-pJna-paticchadanattham] there is a reading ^hirikopJnam
pnticchndanntthnm/'
89.	Alms food is any sort of food. For any sort of nutriment is called "alms food"
(piiidnpnta—lit. "liunp-dropping") because of its having been dropped (pntitnttn)
into a bhikklm's bowl durmg his alins rotuui (pindohja). Or aims food (pindnpntn) is
the dropping (pata) of the lumps (piuda); it is the concurrence (sannipntn), the
collection, of alms (bliikkJin) obtained here and there, is what is meant.
Neither for amusement: neither for the purpose of amusement, as with village
boys, etc.; for the sake of sport, is what is meant. Nor for intoxication: not for the
piupose of intoxication, as with boxers, etc.; for the sake of intoxication with strength
and for the sake of intoxication with manhood, is what is meant. [32] Nor for
smnrteiiiiig: not for the piupose of smartening, as with royal concubines, courtesans,
etc.; for the sake of plumpness in all the limbs, is what is meant. Nor for embellishment:
not for the purpose of embellishment, as with actors, dancers, etc.; for the sake of a
clear skin and complexion, is what is meant.
90.	And here the clause neither for amusement is stated for the purpose of
abandoning support for delusion; nor for intoxication is said for the purpose of
abandoning support for hate; nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the
purpose of abandoning support for greed. And neither for mmisement nor for
intoxication is said for the purpose of preventing the arising of fetters for oneself.
Nor for smartening nor for embellishment is said for the purpose of preventing the
arising of fetters for another. And the abandoning of both unwise practice and
devotion to indulgence of sense pleasures should be imderstood as stated by these
four. Only has the meaning already stated.
91.	Of this body: of this material body consisting of the four great primaries. For
the endurance: for the purpose of continued endurance. And contiminnce: for the
piupose of not iiiterriiptmg [life's continued] occurrence, or for the purpose of
endurance for a long time. He makes use of the alms food for the purpose of the
endurance, for the purpose of the continuance, of the body, as the owner of an old
house uses props for his house, and as a carter uses axle grease, not for the purpose
of amusement, intoxication, smartening, and embellishment. Furthermore,
endurance is a term for the life faculty. So what has been said as far as the words for
the endurance and continuance of this body can be understood to mean: for the purpose
of maintaining the occiurence of the life faculty in this body.
92.	For the ending of discomfort: hunger is called "discomfort" in the sense of
afflicting. He makes use of alms food for the purpose of ending that, like anointing
`33
a wound, like coimteiactiiig heat with cold, and so on. For assisting the life of purity:
for the purpose of assisting the life of purity consisting in the whole dispensation
and the life of purity consisting in the path. For while this [bhikkhu] is engaged in
crossing the desert of existence by means of devotion to the three trainings
depending on bodily strength whose necessary condition is the use of alms food,
he makes use of it to assist the life of purity just as those seeking to cross the desert
used their chilcTs flesh,29 just as those seeking to cross a river use a raft, and just as
those seeking to cross the ocean use a ship.
93. Thus I shall put a stop to old feelings and shall not arouse nexv feelings: [33] thus as
a sick man uses medicine, he uses [alms food, thinking]: "By use of this alms food
I shall put a stop to the old feeling of hunger, and I shall not arouse a new feeling
by immoderate eating, like one of the [proverbial] brahmans, that is, one who eats
till he has to be helped up by hand, or till his clothes will not meet, or till he rolls
there [on the ground], or till crows can peck from his mouth, 01, tin til he vomits
what he has eaten. Or alternatively there is that which is called 'old feelings' because,
being conditioned by former kamma, it arises now in dependence on unsuitable
immoderate eating—I shall put a stop to that old feeling, forestallmg its condition
by suitable moderate eating. And there is that which is called 'new feeling' because
it will arise in the future in dependence on the accumulation of kamma consisting
iii making improper use [of the requisite of alms food] now—I shall also not arouse
that new feeling, avoiding by means of proper use the production of its root. This
is how the meaning should be imderstood here. What has been shown so far can
be imderstood to include proper use [of requisites], abandoning of devotion to
self-mortification, and not giving up lawful bliss (pleasure).
94. And I shall be healthy: "In this body which exists in dependence on requisites,
I shall, by moderate eating, have health called 'long	since there will be
no danger of severing the life faculty 01 interrupting the [continuity of the]
postures." [Reflecting] in this way, he makes use [of the alms food] as a sufferer
from a chronic disease does of his medicine. And blameless and live in comfort (lit.
"and have blamelessness and a comfortable abiding"): he makes use of them
thinking: "I shall have blamelessness by avoiding improper search, acceptance and
eating, and I shall have a conifortable abiding by moderate eating." Or he does so
thinking: "I shall have blamelessness due to absence of such faults as boredom,
sloth, sleepiness, blame by the wise, etc., that have imseemly immoderate eating as
their condition; and I shall have a comfoi table abiding by piodiiciiig bodily strength
that has seemly moderate eating as its condition." Or he does so thinking: "I shall
have blamelessness by abandoning the pleasure of lying down, lolling and torpor,
through refraining from eating as much as possible to stuff the belly； and I shall
have a comfortable abiding by controlling the four postures through eating foiu or
five mouthfuls less than the maximum." For this is said:
29. "Cliihfs flesli" (pmtta-mamsa) is an allusion to the story (SII98) of the couple who
set out to cross a desert with an insufficient food supply but got to the other side by
eating the flesh of their child who died on the way. The derivation given in PED, y/A
metaphor probably distorted from piitamai!is(i,〃 has no justification. The reference to
rafts might be to DII89.
`34
With four or five liunps still to eat
Let him then end by drinking water;
For energetic bhikkhus' needs
This should suffice to live in comfort (Th 983). [34]
Now, what has been shown at this point can be imderstood as discernment of
piupose and practice of the middle way.
95. Resting plnce (senasana): this is the bed (sena) and seat (asann). For wherever
one sleeps (seti), whether in a monastery or in a lean-to, etc., that is the bed (seun);
wherever one seats oneself (asati), sits (nisldati), that is the seat (nsmta). Both together
are called "resting-place" (or "abode"—senasana).
For the purpose ofumrdiiig off the perils of climnte and enjoi/ing retreat: the climate
itself in the sense of imperilling (parisahmta) is "perils of climate" (uhi-yarissaya).
Unsuitable climatic conditions that cause mental distraction due to bodily affliction
can be warded off by making use of the resting place; it is for the piupose of warding
off these and for the piupose of the pleasure of solitude, is what is meant. Of
course, the warding off of the perils of climate is stated by [the phrase] "protection
from cold,〃 etc., too; but, just as in the case of making use of the robes the
concealment of the private parts is stated as an invariable purpose while the others
are periodical [purposes], so here also this [last] should be imderstood as mentioned
with reference to the invariable warding off of the perils of climate. Or alternatively,
this "climate" of the kind stated is just climate; but "perils" are of two kinds: evident
perils and concealed perils (see Nidd 112). Herein, evident perils are lions, tigers,
etcv while concealed perils are greed, hate, and so on. When a bhikkhu knows and
reflects thus in making use of the kind of resting place where these [perils] do not,
owing to unguarded doors and sight of unsuitable visible objects, etc., cause
affliction, he can be imderstood as one who "reflecting wisely makes use of the
resting place for the purpose of warding off the perils of climate."
96. The reqiiisite of medicine ns cure for the sick: here "cure" (jjnccnyn = going against)
is iii the sense of going against (pati-mjana) illness; in the sense of coimtei iiig, is the
meaning. This is a term for any suitable remedy. It is the medical man's work
(bhisnkkassn kammnni) because it is permitted by hiin, thus it is medicine (bJiesnjjn).
Or the cure for the sick itself as medicine is "inedicine as cure for the sick." Any
work of a medical man such as oil, honey ghee, etc., that is suitable for one who is
sick, is what is meant. A "i.equisite〃 (pnrikkharn), however, in such passages as "It is
well supplied with the requisites of a city" (A IV106) is equipment; in such passages
as "The chariot has the requisite of virtue, the axle of jhaiia, the wheel of energy,/
(S V 6) [35] it is an ornament; in such passages as "The requisites for the life of one
who has gone into homelessness that should be available" (M I 104), it is an
accessory. But here both equipment and accessory are applicable. For that medicine
as a cure for the sick is equipment for maintaining life because it protects by
preventing the arising of affliction destructive to life; and it is an accessory too
because it is an iiistnunent for prolonging life. That is why it is called "requisite."
So it is medicine as cure for the sick and that is a requisite, thus it is a "requisite of
medicine as cure for the sick." [He makes use of] that requisite of medicine as cure
`35
lor the sick; any requisite tor liie consisting ol oil, honey, molasses, ghee, etc., that
is allowed by a medical man as suitable for the sick, is what is meant.
97.	From arisen: from born, become, produced. Hurtful: here "hurt (affliction)is
a disturbance of elements, and it is the leprosy tumours, boils, etc., originated by
that dishu’bance. Hurtful (ue\/i/nbnd1iikn) because arisen in the form of hurt (bi/nbndJin).
Feelings: painful feelings, feelings resulting from improfitable kaimna~from those
hurtful feelings. For complete immunity from affliction: for complete freedom from
pain; so that all that is painful is abandoned, is the meaning.
This is how this virtue concerning requisites should be understood. In brief its
chaiacteristic is the use of requisites after wise reflection. The word-meaiiiiig here
is this: because breathing things go (m/anti), move, proceed, using [what they use]
in dependence on these robes, etc., these robes, etc., are therefore called requisites
(yaccaya = ger. of pnti + m/ati); "concerning requisites" is concerning those requisites.
98.	(a) So, in this fourfold virtue, Patiinokklia restraint has to be undertaken by
means of faith. For that is accomplished by faith, since the aimoimcmg of training
precepts is outside the disciples' province; and the evidence here is the refusal of
the request to fallow disciples to] amioimce training precepts (see Vin III 9-10).
Having therefore imdertaken through faith the traiiimg precepts without exception
as announced, one should completely perfect them without regard for life. For
this is said: [36]
"As a hen guards her eggs,
Or as a yak her tail,
_Or like a darling child,_
Or like an only eye—
So you who are engaged
Your vii tue to protect,
Be prudent at all times
And ever scmpulous, (Source untraced)
Also it is said further: "So too, sire, when a training precept for disciples is
announced by me, my disciples do not transgress it even for the sake of life" (A IV
201).
99. And the story of the elders boiutd by robbers in the forest should be imderstood
iii this sense.
It seems that robbers in the MahavattanI Forest bound an elder with black
creepers and made him lie down. While he lay there for seven days he augmented
his insight, and after reaching the fruition of non-return, he died there and was
reborn in the Biahma-woild. Also they boirnd another elder m Tambapamii Island
(Sri Lanka) with string creepers and made him lie down. When a forest fire came
and the creepers were not cut, he established insight and attained Nibbana
sinudtaneously with his death. When the Elder Abhaya, a preacher of the Digha
Nikaya, passed by with five luindred bhikkhus, he saw [what had happened] and he
had the elder's body cremated and a shrine biiilt. Theiefoie let other clansmen also:
Maintain the rules of conduct pure,
Renoimciiig life if there be need,
`36
Rather than break virtue's restraint
By the World's Saviour decreed.
100.	(b) And as Patimokklia restraint is undertaken out of faith, so restraint of the
sense faculties should be imdertaken with mil id fulness. For that is accomplished by
mindfulness, because when the sense faculties' functions are founded on
mindfulness, there is no liability to invasion by covetousness and the rest. So,
recollecting the Fire Discoiu se, which begins thus, "Better, bhikkhus, the extirpation
of the eye faculty by a red-hot burning blazing glowing iron spike than the
apprehension of signs in the particulars of visible objects cognizable by the eye" (S
IV 168), this [restraint] should be properly undertaken by preventing with
umemitting mindfulness any apprehension, in the objective fields consisting of
visible data, etc., of any signs, etc., likely to encourage covetousness, etc., to invade
consciousness occurriiig in connection with the eye door, and so on.
101.	[37] When not undertaken thus, virtue of Patimokkha restraint is
imenduriiig: it does not last, like a crop not fenced in with branches. And it is
raided by the robber defilements as a village with open gates is by thieves. And
lust leaks into his mind as rain does into a badly-roofed house. For this is said:
"Among the visible objects, sotinds, and smells,
And tastes, and tangibles, guard the faculties;
For when these doors are open and imguarded,
Then thieves will come and raid as rtwere a village (?).
And just as with an ill-roofed house
The lain comes leaking in, so too
Will lust come leaking in for siue
Upon an imdeveloped mincT' (Dhp 13).
102.	When it is imdertaken thus, virtue of Patimokkha restraint is endLiriiig: it
lasts, like a crop well fenced in with branches. And it is not raided by the robber
defilements, as a village with well-guarded gates is not by thieves. And lust does
not leak into his mind, as rain does not into a well-roofed house. For this is said:
"Among the visible objects, soimds and smells,
And tastes and tangibles, guard the faculties;
For when these doors are closed and truly guarded,
Thieves will not come and raid as 'tweie a village (?).
"And just as with a well-roofed house
No rain comes leaking in, so too
No lust comes leaking in for siue
Upon a well-developed mind" (Dhp 14).
103.	This, however, is the teaching at its very highest.
This mind is called "quickly tiansfoimed" (A 110), so restraint of the faculties
should be undertaken by removing arisen lust with the contemplation of foulness,
as was done by the Elder Vanglsa soon after he had gone forth. [38]
As the elder was wandering for alms, it seems, soon after going forth, lust arose
iii him on seeing a woman. Thereupon he said to the venerable Ananda:
`37
"I am afire with sensual lust.
And burnmg flames consume my mind;
In pity tell me, Gotama,
How to extinguish it for good" (S 1188).
The elder said:
"You do perceive mistakenly,
That burnmg flames consume your mind.
Look for no sign of beauty there,
For that it is which leads to lust.
See foulness there and keep yom, mind
Harmomously concentrated;
Formations see as alien,
As ill, not self, so this great lust
May be extinguished, and no more
Take fire thus ever and again" (S1188).
The elder expelled his lust and then went on with his aims round.
104.	Moreover, a bhikkhu who is fiilfillmg restraint of the faculties should be like
the Elder Cittagutta resident in the Great Cave at Kiuandaka, and like the Elder
Maha Mitta resident at the Great Monastery of Coi’aka.
105.	In the Great Cave of Kuraiidaka, it seems, there was a lovely painting of the
Renimciation of the Seven Buddhas. A luunber of bhikkhus wandering about among
the dwellings saw the painting and said, "What a lovely painting, venerable sir!"
The elder said: "Foi more than sixty years, friends, I have lived in the cave, and I
did not know whether there was any painting there or not. Now, today, I know it
through those who have eyes." The elder, it seems, though he had lived there for so
long, had never raised his eyes and looked up at the cave. And at the door of his
cave there was a great ironwood tree. And the elder had never looked up at that
either. He knew it was in flower when he saw its petals on the ground each year.
106.	The king heard of the elder's great virtues, and he sent for him three times,
desiring to pay homage to him. When the elder did not go, he had the breasts of all
the women with infants in the town bound and sealed off, [saying] "As long as the
elder does not come let the children go without milk," [39] Out of compassion for
the children the elder went to Mcdiagama. When the king heard [that he had come,
he said] "Go and bring the elder iii. I shall take the precepts." Having had him
brought up into the inner palace, he paid homage to him and provided him with a
meal. Then, saying, "Today, venerable sir, there is no opporttuiity. I shall take the
precepts tomorrow/' he took the elder's bowl. After following him for a little, he
paid homage with the queen and tiuned back. As seven days went by thus, whether
it was the king who paid homage or whether it was the queen, the elder said,
"May the king be happy/'
107.	Bhikkluis asked: "Why is it, venerable sir, that whether it is the king who
pays the homage or the queen you say yMay the king be happy?" The elder replied:
'Triends, I do not notice whether it is the king or the queen." At the end of seven
days [when it was found that:] the elder was not happy living there, he was dismissed
`38
by the king. He went back to the Great Cave at Kuraiidaka. When it was night he
went out onto his walk. A deity who dwelt in the ironwood tree stood by with a
torch of sticks. Then his meditation subject became quite clear and plain. The elder,
[thinking] "How clear my meditation subject is today!" was glad, and immediately
after the middle watch he reached Arahantship, making the whole rock resound.30
108.	So when another clansman seeks his own good:
Let him not be hiuigiy-eyed,
Like a monkey in the groves,
Like a wild deer in the woods,
Like a nervous little child.
Let him go with eyes downcast
Seeing a plough yoke's length before,
That he fall not in the power
Of the forest-monkey mind.
109.	The Elder Maha Mitta's mother was sick with a poisoned tiunoiu: She told
her daughter, who as a bliikkhiuii had also gone forth, "Lady, go to your brother.
Tell him my trouble and bring back some medicine./r She went and told him. The
elder said: "I do not know how to gather root medicines and such things and concoct
a medicine from them. But rather I will tell you a medicine: since I went forth I
have not broken fmy virtue of restraint of] the sense faculties by looking at the
bodily form of the opposite sex with a lustful mind. By this [40] declaration of
truth may my mother get well. Go and tell the lay devotee and rub her body/' She
went and told her what had happened and then did as she had been instructed. At
that very moment the lay devotee's tumour vanished, shrinking awav like a lump
of froth. She got up and uttered a cry of joy: "If the Fully Enlightened One were
still alive, why should he not stroke with his netadorned hand the head of a bhikkhu
like my son?" So:
110.	Let another noble clansman
Gone forth in the Dispensation
Keep, as did the Elder Mitta,
Perfect faculty restramt.
111.	(c) As restraint of the faculties is to be imdertaken by means of inindhilness, so
livelihood purificntion is to be imdertaken by means of energy. For that is accomplished
by energy because the abandoning of wrong livelihood is effected in one who has
rightly applied energy Abandoning, therefore, luibefittiiig wrong search, this should
be luidertaken with energy by means of the right kind of search consisting in going on
aims roimd, etc., avoiding what is of iinpiue origin as though it were a poisonous
snake, and using only requisites of pure origin.
112.	Herein, for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices, any requisites obtained
from the Comnumity from a group of bliikkl'iiis, or from laymen who have confidence
in his special qualities of teaching the Dhaimna, etc., are called "of piue origin." But
30. Making the whole rock resound'\ 'making the whole rock reverberate as one doing
so by means of an earth tremor. But some say that is was owing to the cheering of the
deities who lived there"' (Visnvmht 58).
`39
those obtained on alms roiuui, etc., are of extremely piue oiigiii. For one who has
taken up the ascetic practices, those obtained on alms roiuid, etc., and—as long as this
is in accordance with the rules of the ascetic practices—from people who have
confidence in his special qualities of asceticism, are called "of piue oiigin." And if he
has got putrid iirine with mixed gall nuts and "foLir-sweets"31 for the purpose of curing
a certain affliction, and he eats only the broken gall nuts, thinking, "Other companions
in the life of piuity will eat the 'foiir-sweets。" his luidertakiiig of the ascetic practices
is befitting, for he is then called a bhikkhu who is supreme in the Noble Ones' heritages
(A II28).
113.	As to the robe and the other requisites, no hint, indication, roundabout talk,
or intimation about robes and aims food is allowable for a bhikkhu who is purifying
his livelihood. But a hint, indication, or roundabout talk about a resting place is
allowable for one who has not taken up the ascetic practices. [41]
114.	Herein, a "hint" is when one who is getting the preparing of the groirnd,
etc., done for the purpose of [making] a resting place is asked, "What is being
done, venerable sir? Who is having it done?〃 and he replies, "No one〃； or any
other such giving of hints. An "indication" is saying, "Lay follower, where do you
live?"—〃In a mansion, venerable sir"—"But, lay follower, a mansion is not allowed
for bhikkhus.〃 Or any other such giving of indication. "Roundabout talk" is saying,
"The resting place for the Comnumity of Bhikkhus is crowded"; or any other such
oblique talk.
115.	All, however, is allowed in the case of medicine. But when the disease is
cured, is it or is it not allowed to use the medicine ob tamed in this way? Herein,
the Vinaya specialists say that the opening has been given by the Blessed One,
therefore it is allowable. But the Suttanta specialists say that though there is no
offence, nevertheless the livelihood is sullied, therefore it is not allowable.
116.	But one who does not use hints, indications, roiuidabout talk, or intimation,
though these are permitted by the Blessed One, and who depends only on the
special qualities of fewness of wishes, etc., and makes use onlv of requisites obtained
otherwise than by indication, etc., even when he thus risks his life, is called supreme
iii living in effacement, like the venerable Sariputta.
117.	It seems that the venerable one was ciiltivatmg seclusion at one time, living
iii a certain forest with the Elder Malta Moggallana. One day an affliction ot colic
arose in him, causing him great pain. In the evening the Elder Maha Moggallana
went to attend upon him. Seeing him lying down, he asked what the reason was.
And then he asked, "What used to make you better formerly friend?/r The elder
said, "When I was a layman, friend, my mother used to mix ghee, honey, sugar
and so on, and give me rice gruel with pure milk. That used to make me better.〃
Then the other said, "So be it, friend. If either you or I have merit, perhaps tomonow
we shall get some."
118.	Now, a deity who dwelt in a tree at the end of the walk overheard their
conversation. fTliiiikmgl "I will find rice gruel for the lord tomoi'i'ow," he went
31. "Foui-sweets〃~catumadhura: a medicinal sweet made of fom- ingredients: honey,
palin-sugar, ghee and sesame oil.
`40
meanwhile to the family who was supporting the elder [42] and entered into the
body of the eldest son, causing him disconifort. Then he told the assembled relatives
the price of the cure: "If you prepare rice gruel of such a kind tomorrow for the
elder, I will set this one free." They said: "Even without being told by you we
regularly supply the elder's needs," and on the following day they prepared rice
gruel of the kind needed.
119.	The Elder Malta Moggallana came in the morning and said, "Stay here, friend,
till I come back from the aims round." Then he went into the village. Those people
met him. They took his bowl, filled it with the stipulated kind of rice gruel, and
gave it back to him. The elder made as though to go, but they said, "Eat, venerable
sir, we shall give you more." When the elder had eaten, they gave him another
bowlful. The elder left. Bringing the alins food to the venerable Sariputta, he said,
"Here, friend Sariputta, eat." When the elder saw it, he thought, "The gruel is very
nice. How was it got?〃 and seeing how it had been obtained, he said, "Friend, the
alms food cannot be used."
120.	Instead of thinking, "He does not eat alms food brought by the likes of me,〃
the other at once took the bowl by the rim and turned it over on one side. As the
rice gruel fell on the groirnd the elder's affliction vanished. From then on it did not
appear again durmg forty-five years.
121.	Then he said to the venerable Maha Moggallana, "Fiiend, even if one's bowels
come out and trail on the ground, it is not fitting to eat gruel got by verbal
intimation,^ and he littered this exclamation:
My livelihood might well be blamed
If I were to consent to eat
The honey and the gruel obtained
By influence of verbal hints.
And even if my bowels obtrude
And trail outside, and even though
My life is to be jeopardized,
I will not blot my livelihood (Mil 370).
For I will satisfy my heart
By shiuming all wrong kinds of search;
And never will I imdertake
The search the Buddhas have condemned. [43]
122 And here too should be told the story of the Elder Maha Tissa the Maitgo-
eater who lived at Clragumba32 (see §132 below). So m all respects:
32. "The Elder Maha Tissa, it seems, was going on a joiuney diuiiig a famine, and
being tired in body and weak through lack of food and travel weariness, he lay down at
the root of a mango tree covered with fruit. There were many fallen mangoes here and
there" (Vism-mht 60). "Through ownerless mangoes were lying fallen on the groirnd
near him, he would not eat them in the absence of someone to accept them fiom" (Vism-
nilit 65). "Then a lay devotee, who was older than he, went to the elder, and learning of
his exhaustion, gave him mango juice to diink. Then he mounted him on his back and
`41
A man who has gone forth in faith
Should purify his livelihood
And, seeing clearly give no thought
To any search that is not good.
123.	(d) And as livelihood purification is to be Lmdertaken by means of energy
so virtue dependent on requisites is to be imdertaken by means of iinderstanding. For
that is accomplished by imderstandmg, because one who possesses imderstaiuimg
is able to see the advantages and the dangers in requisites. So one should abandon
greed for requisites and imdertake that virtue by using requisites obtained lawfully
and properly after reviewing them with understanding in the way aforesaid.
124.	Herein, reviewing is of two kinds: at the time of receiving requisites and at
the time of using them. For use (pnribliogn) is blameless in one who at the time of
receiving robes, etc., reviews them either as [mere] elements or as repulsive,33 and
puts them aside for later use, and in one who reviews them thus at the time of
using them.
125.	Here is an explanation to settle the matter. There are four kinds of use: use
as theft,34 use as a debt?, use as an inheritance, use as a master. Herein, use by one
who is luwirtuous and makes use [of requisites], even sitting in the midst of the
Comnumity is called "use as theft. Use withoat reviewing by one who is virtuous
is "use as a debt"; therefore the robe should be reviewed every time it is used, and
the aims food lump by lump. One who cannot do this [should review it] before the
meal, after the meal, in the first watch, in the middle watch, and in the last watch.
If dawn breaks on him without his having reviewed it, he finds himself in the
position of one who has used it as a debt. Also the resting place should be reviewed
each time it is used. Recourse to mindfulness both in the accepting and the use of
medicine is proper; but while this is so, though there is an offence for one who uses
it without mindfulness after mindful acceptance, there is no offence for one who is
mindful in using after accepting without mindfulness.
126. Piuification is of four kinds: purification by the Teaching, purification by
restramt, piuification by search, and piuification by reviewing. Herein, virtue of
took him to his home. Meanwhile the elder admonished himself as follows: 'Nor your
mother nor your father/ etc. (see §133). And beginning the comprehension [of
formations], and augmenting insight, he realized Arahantship after the other paths in
due succession while he was still mounted on his back" (Vism-mht 60).
33.	u,As elements, in this way: 'This robe, etc., consists merely of [the four] elements
and occius when its conditions are present; and the person who uses it [likewise] / 'As
iii this way: Firstly perception of repiilsiveness in nutriment in the case of
aims food; then as bringing repiilsiveness to mind thus: 'But all these robes, etc., which
are not in themselves disgusting, become utterly disgusting on reaching this filthy
body"' (Vism-mht 61).
34.	'"Use as theft': use by one who is miwoithy. And the requisites are allowed by the
Blessed One to one in his own dispensation who is virtuous, not imvirtnous; and the
generosity of the givers is towards one who is virtuous, not towards one who is not,
since they expect great fruit from their actions" (Vism-mht 61; cf. MN 142 and
coimnentary).
`42
the Patiinokklia restrniut is called "purification by the Teaching"; [44] for that is so
called because it purifies by means of teaching. Virtue of restrniut offaculties is called
^purification by lestiaint"; for that is so called because it purifies by means of the
restramt in the mental resolution, "I shall not do so again." Virtue of livelihood
ptirificntion is called "purification by search"; for that is so called because search is
purified in one who abandons wrong search and gets requisites lawfully and
properly. Virtue dependent on requisites is called '"piuification by reviewing"; for
that is so called because it purifies by the reviewing of the kind already described.
Hence it was said above (§125): "There is no offence for one who is mindful in
using after accepting without inindfulness."
127.	Use of the requisites by the seven kinds of tiaineis is called "use as an
inheritance"; for they are the Buddha's sons, therefore they make use of the
requisites as the heirs of requisites belonging to their father. But how then, is it the
Blessed One's requisites or the laity's requisites that are used? Although given by
the laity they actually belong to the Blessed One, because it is by the Blessed One
that they are peiinitted. That is why it should be imderstood that the Blessed One's
requisites are used. The confirmation here is in the Dhaimnadayada Sutta (MN 3).
Use by those whose cankers are destroyed is called "use as a master"; for they
make use of them as masters because they have escaped the slavery of craving.
128.	As regards these kinds of use, use as a master and use as an inheiitance are
allowable for all. Use as a debt is not allowable, to say nothing of use as theft. But
this use of what is reviewed by one who is virtuous is use freed from debt because
it is the opposite of use as a debt or is included in use as an inheritance too. For one
possessed of virtue is called a tramer too because of possessing this training.
129. As regards these three kinds of use, since use as a master is best, when a
bhikklui imdertakes virtue dependent on requisites, he should aspire to that and use
them after reviewing them in the way described. And this is said: [45]
"The truly wise disciple
Who listens to the Dhamma
As taught by the Sublime One
Makes use, after reviewing,
Of alms food, and of dwelling,
And of a resting place,
And also of the water
For washing dix t from l'obes" (Sn 391).
"So like a drop of water
Lying on leaves of lotus,
A bhikkhu is unsullied
By any of these matters,
By aims food, [and by dwelling,]
And by a resting place,
And also by the water
For washing dirt from robes'" (Sn 392).
`43
"Since aid it is and timely
Procured from another
The right ainoimt he reckons,
Mindful without remitting
In chewing and in eating,
In tasting food besides:
He treats it as an ointment
Applied upon a wound." (Source imtraced)
"So like the chilcTs flesh in the desert
Like the greasing for the axle,
He should eat without delusion
Nutriment to keep alive, (Source imtraced)
130. And in connection with the fulfilling of this virtue dependent on requisites
there should be told the story of the novice Sahgharakkliita the Nephew. For he
made use of requisites after reviewing, according as it is said:
"Seeing me eat a dish of rice
Quite cold, my preceptor observed:
'Novice, if you are not restrained,
Be careful not to burn your tongue/
On hearing my Preceptor's words,
I then and there felt urged to act
And, sitting in a single session,
_I reached the goal of Arahaiitsliip._
Since I am now waxed full in thought
Like the full moon of the fifteenth (M III 277),
And all my cankers are destroyed,
There is no more becoming now, [46]
And so should any other man
Aspiring to end siiffermg
Make use of all the requisites
Wisely after reviewing them.
So viitue is of four kinds as "virtue of Patimokkha restraint/7 and so on.
131. 18. In the first pentad in the fivefold section the meaning should be
luuierstood in accordance with the vii tue of those not fully admitted to the Order,
and so on. For this is said in the Patisainbhida: "(a) What is virtue consisting in
limited purification? That of the training precepts for those not fully admitted to
the Order: such is virtue consisting in limited purification, (b) What is virtue
consisting in unlimited purification? That of the haining precepts for those fully
admitted to the Older: such is virtue consisting in lu'diiiiited purification, (c) What
is virtue consisting in fulfilled purification? That of magnanimous ordmaiy men
devoted to profitable things, who are perfecting [the comsel that ends in traineiship,
regardless of the physical body and life, having given up [attachment to] life: such is
virtue of fulfilled piuification, (d) What is virtue consisting m piuification not adhered
to? Tliat of tlie seven kinds of trainer: such is viitue consisting in piuification not adliered
to. (e) What is vii tue consisting in haiiqiiillized piuification? That of the Perfect One's
`44
disciples with cankers destroyed, of the Paccekabuddhas, ot the Perfect Ones,
accomplished and fully enlightened: such is virtue consisting in tranquillized
piuification7' (Patis 142-43).
132.	(a) Herein, the virtue of those not fully admitted to the Order should be
imderstood as virtue consisting in limited purificntion, because it is limited by the
niunber [of tmining precepts, that is, five or eight or ten].
(b) That of those fully admitted to the Older is fdescribable] thus:
Nine thousand millions, and a luindred
And eighty millions then as well,
And fifty plus a hundred thousand,
And thirty-six again to swell.
The total restraint disciplines:
These rules the Enlightened One explains
Told under heads for filling out,
Which the Discipline restraint contains.35
So although limited in number, [47] it should yet be understood as virtue
consisting in iinlwiited purification, since it is undertaken without reserve and has
no obvious limit such as gain, fame, relatives, limbs or life. Like the virtue of the
Elder Malia Tissa the Mango-eatei who lived at Clragiunba (see §122 above).
133.	For that venerable one never abandoned the following good man's
recollection:
"Wealth for a soirnd limb's sake should be renounced,
And one who guards his life gives up his limbs;
And wealth and limbs and life, each one of these,
A man gives up who practices the Dhamma."
And he never transgressed a iraining precept even when his life was in the
balance, and in this way he reached Arahantship with that same vii tue of lu'diiiiited
purification as his support while he was being carried on a lay devotee's back.
According to as it is said:
"Nor your mother nor your father
Nor yoiir relatives and kin
Have done as much as this for you
Because you are possessed of virtue/'
So, stirred with urgency and wisely
Comprehending36 with insight,
35.	The figiues depend on whether koti is taken as 1,000,000 01 100,000 or 10,000.
36.	"Coinpi.ehending" (sammasana) is a technical term that will become clear in
Chapter XX. In short, it is inference that generalizes the "three characteristics" from
one's own directly-known experience to all possible formed experience at all times
(see S H 107). Commenting on “He comprehended that same ilhtess" (§138), Vism-mht
says: "He exercised insight by discerning the feeling in the illness imder the heading
of the feeling [aggregate] and the remaining material dhammas as materiality"
(Vism-mht 65).
`45
While carried on his helper's back
He reached the goal of Arahantship.
134.	(c) The magnanimous ordinary man's virtue, which from the time of
admission to the Order is devoid even of the stain of a [wrong] thought because of
its extreme purity like a gem of purest water, like well-refined gold, becomes the
proximate cause for Arahantship itself, which is why it is called consisting of fulfilled
ptirificntioii; like that of the lders Sangharakkliita the Great and Saiigharakkliita
the Nephew.
135.	The Elder Scuigharakkliita the Great {Matin SnngJiarakkJiita), aged over sixty
was lying, it seems, on his deathbed. The Order of Bhikkhus questioned him about
attainment of the supranumdaiie state. The elder said: "I have no supianumdaiie
state." Then the yoimg bhikkhu who was attending on him said: "Venerable sir,
people have come as much as twelve leagues, thinking that you have reached
Nibbana. It will be a disappointment for many if you die as an oidinaiy man."—
"Friend, thinking to see the Blessed One Metteyya, I did not try for insight. [48] So
help me to sit up and give me the chance." He helped the elder to sit lip and went
out. As he went out the elder reached Arahantsliip and he gave a sign by snapping
his fingers. The Order assembled and said to him: "Venerable sir, you have done a
difficult tiling in achieving the supianumdaiie state in the hoiu of death/'—"That was
not difficult, friends. But rather I will tell you what is difficult. Friends, I see no action
done [by me] without mindftdness and mikiiowmgly since the time I went forth." His
nephew also reached Arahantship in the same way at the age of fifty years.
136	._"Now, if a man has little learning_
And he is careless of his virtue,
They censure him on both accounts
For lack of virtue and of learnmg.
"But if he is of little learning
Yet he is careful of his virtue,
They praise him for his virtue, so
It is as though he too had learning.
"And if he is of ample learning
Yet he is careless of his virtue,
They blame him for his virtue, so
It is as though he had no learnmg.
"But if he is of ample learning
And he is careful of his virtue,
They give him praise on both accoimts
For vii tue and as well for learning.
"The Buddha's pupil of much learnmg
Who keeps the Law with imderstandmg—
A jewel of Jambu River gold37
Who is here fit to censure him?
37. A story of the Jambu River and its gold is given at M-a IV 147.
`46
Deities praise him [constantly!,
By Brahma also is he praised (A II 7).
137.	(d) What should be understood as virtue consisting in purification not adhered
to is trainers7 virtue, because it is not adhered to by [false] view, and ordmary
men's virtue when not adhered to by greed. Like the virtue of the Elder Tissa the
Landowner's Son (Kutiimlm/nputtn-Tissn-thern). Wanting to become established in
Aiahantship in dependence on such virtue, this venerable one told his enemies:
I broke the bones of both my legs
To give the pledge you asked from me.
I am revolted and ashamed
At death accompanied by greed. [49]
"And after I had thought on this,
And wisely then applied insight,
When the sim rose and shone on me,
I had become an Aiahant" (M-a 1233).
138.	Also there was a certain senior elder who was very ill and imable to eat with
his own hand. He was writhing smeared with his own m ine and excrement. Seeing
him, a certain yoiing bhikklui said, "Oh, what a painful process life is!" The senior
elder told him: "If I were to die now, friend, I should obtain the bliss of heaven; I
have no doubt of that. But the bliss obtained by breaking this virtue would be like
the lay state obtained by disavowing the haining," and he added: "I shall die
together with my viitue." As he lay there, he comprehended that same illness
『with iiisightL and he reached Aiahaiitslilp. Having done so, he pronoiuiced these
verses to the Order of Bhikkhus:
"I am victim of a sickening disease
That racks me with its biuden of cruel pain;
As flowers in the dust burnt by the sun,
So this my corpse will soon have withered up.
"Unbeautiful called beautiful,
Unclean while reckoned as if clean,
Though full of ordure seeming fair
To him that cannot see it clear.
"So out upon this ailing rotting body,
Fetid and filthy punished with affliction,
Doting on which this silly generation
Has lost the way to be reborn in heaven!(J-a II437)
139.	(e) It is the viitue of the Arahants, etc., that should be understood as
tranquillized purification, because of tranqnillization of all disturbance and because
of piuifiedness.
So it is of five kinds as "consisting in limited piuification/7 and so on.
140.	19. In the second pentad the meaning should be understood as the
abandoning, etc., of killing living tilings, etc.; for this is said in the Patisainbhida:
"Five kinds of virtue: (1) In the case of killing living things, (a) abandoning is
`47
virtue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is virtue, (d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-
transgression is virtue. (2) In the case of taking what is not given ... (3) In the case
of sexual misconduct …（4) In the case of false speech …（5) In the case of malicious

(11) "丁hroiigh renimciation in the case of lust, (a) abandoning is virtue ... (12)

(15) Through definition of states (dhnmmn) ... uncertainty ... (16) Through

(18) "Through the first jhaiia in the case of the hindrances, (a) abandoning is viitue
.• • (19) Through the second jhaiia ... applied and sustained thought.. • (20) Through
the third jhaiia •.. happiness • • • (21) Through the fourth jhaiia in the case of pleasme

(26) "Through the contemplation of impeimanence in the case of the perception

(33) "Through the contemplation of destruction in the case of the perception of

[on formations] ... (42) Through reflection in the case of non-reflection ... (43)
Through the contemplation of turning away in the case of misinterpreting
(insistence) due to bondage ...
`48
(44) "Through the path of stream-entry in the case of defilements coefficient
with [false] view, (a) abandoning is virtue ... (45) Through the path of once-retum
iii the case of gross defilements ... (46) Through the path of non-return in the case
of residual defilements ... (47) Through the path of Arahantship in the case of all
defilements, (a) abandoning is vii tue, (b) abstention is virtue, (c) volition is virtue,
(d) restraint is virtue, (e) non-transgression is virtue.
"Such virtues lead to non-remorse in the mind, to gladdening, to happiness, to
haiiqiiillitY to joy to repetition, to development, to cultivation, to embeilishment, to
the requisite [for concentration!, to the equipment [of concentiation], to fulfilment, to
complete dispassion, to fading away to cessation, to peace, to direct-knowledge, to
eiilightemnent, to Nibb 如 a."38 (Patis 146-47)
141. And here there is no state called abandoning other than the mere non-arisiiig
of the killing of living things, etc., as stated. But the abandoning of a given
[improfitable state] upholds [51] a given profitable state in the sense of providing a
foimdation for it, and concentrates it by preventing wavering, so it is called "virtue"
(siln) iii the sense of composing (silmia), reckoned as upholding and concentrating
as stated earlier (§19).
The other four tilings mentioned refer to the presence39 of occurrence of will as
abstention from such and such, as restraint of such and such, as the volition
associated with both of these, and as non-transgression in one who does not
transgress such and such. But their meaning of virtue has been explained already.
So it is of five kinds as "virtue consisting in abandoning" and so on.
142.	At this point the answers to the questions, "What is viitue? In what sense is
it virtue? What are its characteristic, function, manifestation, and proximate cause?
Wliat are the benefits of vii tue? How many kinds of virtue are there?" are complete.
143.	However, it was also asked (vi) What is the defiling of it? and What is the
CLEANSING OF IT?
We answer that virtue's tornness, etc., is its defiling, and that its iintornness,
etc., is its cleansing. No\^ that tomness, etc., are comprised imder the breach that
has gain, fame, etc., as its cause, and imder the seven bonds of sexuality. When a
man has broken the tmining course at the beginning or at the end in any instance
of the seven classes of offences,40 his virtue is called torn, like a cloth that is cut at
the edge. But when he has broken it in the middle, it is called rent, like a cloth that
38.	This list describes, in terms of abandoning, etc., the stages in the normal progress
from ignorance to Arahantship, and it falls into the following groups: I. Virtue: the
abandoning of the ten improfitable courses of action (1-10). II. Concentration: A.
abandoning the seven hindrances to concentiation by means of their opposites (11-
17); B. The eight attainments of concentiation, and what is abandoned by each (18-25).
EH. Understanding: A. Insight: the eighteen piiiicipal insights beginning with the seven
contemplations (26-43). B. Paths: The foiu paths and what is abandoned by each (44rA7).
39.	Sabbhava—"presence" ( = sat + bhava): not in PED. Not to be coiiftised with snblmva—
"individual essence" ( = sa (Skr. sva) + bhava, or saha + bhava).
40.	The seven consisting of parajika, sanghadisesa, pacittiya, patidesamx/a, dukkata,
thullaccaya, dubbhasita (mentioned at M-a II33).
`49
is rent in the middle. When he has broken it twice 01 thrice in succession, it is
called blotched, like a cow whose body is some such colour as black or red with a
discrepant colour appearing on the back or the belly. When he has broken it fall
over] at intervals, it is called mottled, like a cow speckled fall over] with discrepaiit-
coloiued spots at intervals. This in the first place, is how there comes to be tornness
with the breach that has gain, etc., as its cause.
144.	And likewise with the seven bonds of sexuality; for this is said by the Blessed
One: "Here, biahman, some ascetic or brahman claims to lead the life of pmity
rightly; for he does not [52] enter into actual sexual intercourse with women. Yet
he agrees to massage, maiiipillation, bathing and mbbiiig down by women. He
enjoys it, desires it and takes satisfaction in it. This is what is torn, rent, blotched
and mottled in one who leads the life of purity. This man is said to lead a life of
purity that is imcleait. As one who is boirnd by the bond of sexuality he will not be
released from birth, ageing and death ... he will not be released from siiffeiing, I
say.
145.	"Furthei'moie, biahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
jokes, plays and aimises liiinself with women ...
146.	"Furthei'moie, brahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
gazes and stares at women eye to eye ...
147.	"Furthei'moie, brahman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
listens to the soiuid of women through a wall or through a fence as they laugh or
talk or sing or weep ...
148.	"Furtheimoie, bmhman,... while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
recalls laughs and talks and games that he formerly had with women ...
149.	"Furthei’moie, brahman, ... while he does not agree to [these things], [53]
yet he sees a householder or a householder's son possessed of, endowed with, and
indulging in, the five cords of sense desire ...
150.	'Turthermore, brahman, while he does not agree to [these tilings], yet he
leads the life of purity aspiring to some order of deities, fthiiikmg] Through this
rite (viitue) or this ritual (vow) or this asceticism I shall become a [great] deity or
some [lesser] deity/ He enjoys it, desires it, and takes satisfaction in it. This,
brahman, is what is torn, rent, blotched and mottled in one who leads the life of
piuity. This man ... will not be released from siiffermg, I say" (A IV 54-56).
This is how tomness, etc., should be understood as included under the breach
that has gain, etc., as its cause and imder the seven bonds of sexuality.
151 Untornness, however, is accomplished by the complete non-breakiiig of
the training precepts, by making amends for those broken for which amends shcndd
be made, by the absence of the seven bonds of sexuality and, as well, by the non-
arisiiig of such evil things as anger, enmity contempt, doniineermg, envy avarice,
deceit, fraud, obduracy presiunption, pride (conceit), haughtiness, conceit (vanity),
and negligence (MN 7), and by the arising of such qualities as fewness of wishes,
contentment, and effacement (MN 24).
`50
152.	Virtues not broken for the purpose of gain, etc., and rectified by making
amends after being broken by the faults of negligence, etc., and not damaged by
the bonds of sexuality and by such evil things as anger and enmity, are called
entirely mi tom, muent, imblotched, and luunottled. And those same virtues are
libernting since they bring about the state of a freeman, and praised by the wise
since it is by the wise that they are praised, and linadhered-to since they are not
adhered to by means of craving and views, and conducive to concentrntion since
they conduce to access concentration or to absorption concentration. That is why
their untornness, etc., should be understood as "cleansing" (see also VELlOlf.).
153.	This cleansing comes about in two ways: through seeing the danger of failure
in vii tue, and through seeing the benefit of perfected virtue. [54] Herein, the danger
of failure in virtue can be seen in accordance with such suttas as that beginning,
"Bhikkhus, there are these five dangers for the imvii tuous in the failure of virtue"
(A III 252).
154.	Furthermore, on account of his luwirtuousness an luwirtuous person is
displeasing to deities and hiunaii beings, is uninstmctable by his fellows in the life
of purity suffers when luwirtuousness is censured, and is remorseful when the
virtuous are praised. Owing to that luwirtuousness he is as ugly as hemp cloth.
Contact with him is painful because those who fall in with his views are brought
to long-lasting suffering in the states of loss. He is worthless because he causes no
great fruit fto accrue] to those who give him gifts. He is as hard to purify as a
cesspit many years old. He is like a log from a pyre (see It 99); for he is outside
both [recluseship and the lay state]. Though claiming the bhikkhu state he is no
bhikklui, so he is like a donkey following a herd of cattle. He is always nervous,
like a mail who is everyone's enemy. He is as unfit to live with as a dead carcase.
Though he may have the qualities of learning, etc., he is as mifit for the homage of
his fellows in the life of purity as a charnel-ground fire is for that of brahmans. He
is as incapable of reaching the distinction of attainment as a blind man is of seeing
a visible object. He is as careless of the Good Law as a guttersnipe is of a kingdom.
Though he fancies he is happy, yet he suffers because he reaps suffermg as told in
the Discourse on the Mass of Fiie (A IV 128-34).
155. Now^ the Blessed One has shown that when the imvii'tuous have their minds
captured by pleasure and satisfaction in the mdiilgence of the five cords of sense
desires, in [receiving] salutation, in being honoured, etc., the result of that kanuna,
directly visible in all ways, is very violent pain, with that [kamma] as its condition,
capable of produciiig a gush of hot blood by causing agony of heart with the mere
recollection of it. Here is the text:
"Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing and glowing?—
Yes, venerable sir.一What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one [gone
forth] should sit down or lie down embracing that mass of fire burnmg, blazing
and glowing, 01 that he should sit down 01 lie down embracing a warrior-noble
maiden or a biahinan maiden 01 a maiden of householder family with soft, delicate
hands and feet?—It would be better, venerable sir, that he should sit down 01 lie
down embracing a warrior-noble maiden ... [55] It would be painful, venerable sir,
`51
li he sat down or lay down embracmg that great mass ol lire burmng, blazing and
glowing.
156.	"I say to you, bhikkhus, I declare to you, bhikkhus, that it would be better
for one [gone forth] who is imvii tuous, who is evil-natured, of unclean and suspect
habits, secretive of his acts, who is not an ascetic and claims to be one, who does
not lead the life of purity and claims to do so, who is rotten within, lecherous, and
full of corruption, to sit down or lie down embracing that great mass of fire bm.ning,
blazing and glowing. Why is that? By his doing so, bhikklius, he might come to
death or deadly suffermg, yet he would not on that account, on the breakup of the
body after death, reappear in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny, in perdition, in
hell. But if one who is imviituous, evil-natured ... and full of corruption, should
sit down or lie down embracmg a warrior-noble maiden ... that would be long for
his harm and siiffermg: on the break-up of the body after death, he would reappear
in states of loss, in an unhappy destiny in perdition, in hell〃 (A IV 128-29).
157.	Having thus shown by means of the analogy of the mass of fiie the suffering
that is boimd lip with women and has as its condition the indulgence of the five
cords of sense desires fby the luwirtuousl, to the same intent he showed, by the
following similes of the horse-hair rope, the sharp spear, the iron sheet, the iron
ball, the iron bed, the iron chair, and the iron cauldron, the pain that has as its
condition [acceptance of] homage and reverential salutation, and the use of robes,
alms food, bed and chair, and dwelling [by luwirtuous bhikkhus]:
"What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a strong horse-
haii' rope twisted roiuid both legs by a strong man and tightened so that it cut through
the outer skin, and having cut through the outer skin it cut through the inner skin, and
having cut through the inner skin, it cut through the flesh, and having cut through the
flesh it cut through the sinews, and having cut through the sinews it cut through the
bones, and having cut through the bones it remained cmshing the bone marrow~or
that he should consent to the homage of great wairior-nobles, great bralunaiis, great
householders?" (A IV 129). [56]
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one should have a
strong man woirnd one's breast with a sharp spear tempered in oil~01 that he
should consent to the reverential salutation of great wairior-nobles, great biahmans,
great householders?" (A IV 130).
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's body should be
wrapped by a strong man in a red-hot iron sheet burmng, blazing and glowing—
or that he should use robes given out of faith by great warrioi-nobles, great
brahmans, great householders?" (A IV 130-31).
And: "What do you think, bhikkhus, which is better, that one's mouth should
be prised open by a strong man with red-hot iron tongs bmnmg, blazing and
glowing, and that into his mouth should be put a red-hot iron ball Luuning, blazing
and glowing, which bians his lips and biuns his mouth and tongue and throat: and
belly and passes out below carrying with it his bowels and entrails~or that he should
use alms food given out of faith by great Wcurior-nobles …？"（A IV 131-32).
`52
And: "What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a strong
man seize him by the head or seize him by the shoulders and seat him or lay him on a
red-hot iron bed or iron chair, biuiiiiig, blazing and glowing~or that he should use a
bed or chair given out of faith by great warrior-nobles …？"（A IV 132-33).
And: "What do you think, bhikkluis, which is better, that one should have a
strong man take him feet up and head down and plimge him into a red-hot metal
cauldron burning, blazing and glowing, to be boiled there in a swirl of fioth, and as
he boils in the swirl of froth to be swept now up, now down, and now across~or that
he should use a dwelling given out of faith by great wairior-nobles …？" (A IV133-34).
158.	What pleasure has a man of broken virtue
Forsaking not sense pleasiues, which bear fruit
Of pain more violent even than the pain
In the embracing of a mass of fiie?
What pleasure has he in accepting homage
Who, having failed in virtue, must partake
Of pain that will excel in agony
The cmshing of his legs with horse-hair ropes? [57]
What pleasure has a man devoid of virtue
Accepting salutations of the faithful,
Which is the cause of pain acuter still
Than pain produced by stabbing with a spear?
What is the pleasure in the use of garments
For one without restraint, whereby in hell
He will for long be forced to luidergo
The contact of the blazing iron sheet?
Although to him his alms food may seem tasty,
Who has no virtue, it is direst poison,
Because of which he surely will be made
For long to swallow burmng iron balls.
And when the vii tueless make use of couches
And chairs, though reckoned pleasing, it is pain
Because they will be tortmed long indeed
On red-hot blazing iron beds and chairs.
Then what delight is there for one unvirhious
Inhabiting a dwelling given in faith,
Since for that reason he will have to dwell
Shut up inside a blazing iron pan?
The Teacher of the world, in him condemning,
Described him in these terms: "Of suspect habits,
Full of corruption, lecherous as well,
By nature evil, rotten too within."
So out upon the life of him abiding
Without restraint, of him that wears the guise
`53
Of the ascetic that he will not be,
And damages and imdermines himself!
What is the life he leads, since any person,
No matter who, with virtue to his credit
Avoids it here, as those that would look well
Keep far away from dung or from a corpse?
He is not free from any sort of terror,
Though free enough from pleasure of attainment;
While heaven's door is bolted fast against him,
He is well set upon the road to hell.
Who else if not one destitute of virtue
More fit to be the object of compassion?
Many indeed and grave are the defects
That brand a man neglectful of his virtue.
Seeing danger in the failure of virtue should be imderstood as reviewing in
such ways as these. And seeing benefits in perfected vii-tue should be imderstood
in the opposite sense.
159. Furthermore: [58]
His virtue is immaculate,
His wearing of the bowl and robes
Gives pleasure and inspires trust,
His going forth will bear its fruit.
A bhikkhu in his vii tue pure
Has never fear that self-reproach
Will enter in his heart: indeed
There is no darkness in the sm\.
A bhikkhu in his virtue bright
Shines forth in the Ascetics' Wood41
As by the brightness of his beams
The moon lights up the firmament.
Now, if the bodily perfiune
Of virtuous bhikkhus can succeed
In pleasing even deities,
What of the perfume of his viitue?
It is more perfect far than all
The other perfiunes in the world,
Because the perfiune virtue gives
Is borne imchecked in all directions.
The deeds done for a virtuous man,
Though they be few, will bear much fruit,
41. An allusion to the Gosiiiga Suttas (MN 31, 32).
`54
And so the virtuous man becomes
A vessel of honour and renown.
There are no cankers here and now
To plague the virtuous man at all;
The virtuous man digs out the root
Of suffermg in lives to come.
Perfection among human kind
And even among deities.
If wished for, is not hard to gain
For him whose vii tue is perfected;
But once his virtue is perfected,
His mind then seeks no other kind
han the perfection of Nibbana,
The state where utter peace prevails.
Such is the blessed fruit of virtue,
Showing full many a varied form,
So let a wise man know it well
This root of all perfection's branches.
160. The mind of one who imderstands thus, shudders at failure in viitue and
reaches out towards the perfecting of vii tue. So vii tue should be cleansed with all
care, seeing this danger of failure in viitue and this benefit of the perfection of
vii tue in the way stated.
161. And at this point in the Path of Purification, which is shown under the headings
of virtue, concentration and understanding by the stanza, "When a wise man,
established well in virtue" (§1), virtue, firstly, has been fully illustrated.

The first chapter called "The Description of Virtue" in the

Chapter II
The Ascetic Practices
(Dhutaiiga-niddesa)
1.	[59] Now, while a meditator is engaged in the pursuit of virtue, he should set
about imdertakiiig the ascetic practices in order to perfect those special qualities
of fewness of wishes, contentment, etc., by which the virtue of the kind already
described, is cleansed. For when his virtue is thus washed clean of stains by the
waters of such special qualities as fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement,
seclusion, dispersal, energy and modest needs, it will become quite purified; and
his vows will succeed as well. And- so, when his whole behavioiu has been piuified
by the special quality of blameless virtue and vows and he has become established
in the [first] three of the ancient Noble Ones' heritages, he may become worthy to
attain to the fourth called /ydelight in development" (A II 27). We shall therefore
begin the explanation of the ascetic practices.
[The 13 kinds of Ascetic Practices]
2.	Tliirteen kinds of ascetic practices have been allowed by the Blessed One to
clansmen who have given lip the things of the flesh and, regardless of body and
Iite, are desirous of imdertakmg a practice in confoimity [with their aim]. They

(3) The imdertakiiig and directions,
`56
And then the grade, and breach as well,
And benefits of each besides,
(4)	As to the profitable triad,
(5)	"Ascetic" and so on distmgiiished,
(6)	And as to groups, and also (7) singly,
The exposition should be known. [60]
4. 1. Herein, as to meaning, in the first place.
i.	It is "refuse” (pmnsiikfiln) since, owing to its being found on refuse in any
such place as a street, a charnel groirnd, or a midden, it belongs, as it were, to the
refuse in the sense of being diunped in anyone of these places. Or alternatively：
like refuse it gets to a vile state (PAMSU viya KUcchitabhavmn ULAti), thus it is
"refuse" (pamsuktlln); it goes to a vile state, is what is meant. The wearing of a
refiise-fragl, which has acquired its derivative name1 in this way is "i,efuse-[i'ag-
wearing]" (patnsnkula). That is his habit, thus he is a ^refuse-frag-wear-Jei^
{pmnsukulika). The practice (anga) of the ref use- f rag-wear-1er is the ^refuse-frag-
weai-]er's practice" (ymnsiikulikaiiga). It is the action that is called the "practice."
Therefore it should be imderstood as a term for that by undertaking which one
becomes a refuse- fi ag-wear-] er.
ii.	In the same way, he has the habit of [wearing] the triple robe (ti-cwara)—in
other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the innei clothing—
other words, the cloak of patches, the upper garment, and the inner clothing—
thus he is a "hiple-robe-fweai-lei" (tecwarika). His practice is called the 7/triple-
robe-wearer's practice/'
5.	iii. The dropping (patn) of the lumps (pinda) of material sustenance (njnisn)
called alms (bhikkJin) is "alms food" (pindnpntn); the falling (nipntmm) into the bowl
of liunps (yinda) given by others, is what is meant. He gleans that alms food (that
falling of lumps), he seeks it by approaching such and such a family, thus he is
called an "alms-food [eat-]er" (yindnpntikn). Or his vow is to gather (pntituin)2 the
lump (p)iiidn)f thus he is a "liunp-gatherer" (piiidnpntin). To "gather” is to wander
for. A "liunp-gathei.ei." (pindnpntin) is the same as an "alms-food-eater" (pindnpntikn).
The practice of the alins-food-eater is the "alins-food-eater's practice/'
6.	iv. It is a hiatus (nimkhnndana) that is called a "gap" (dana).3 It is removed (apeta)
from a gap, thus it is called "gapless" (npadmin); the meaning is, it is without hiatus.
It is together with (saha) what is gapless (npcidmw), thus it is "with the gapless"
(snpndmin); devoid of hiatus—from house to house—is what is meant. His habit is
to wander on what:-is-wit:lvthe-gapless, thus he is a "gapless wanderei ^ (snpndniin-
carin). A gapless wanderer is the same as a "house-to-house-seekei," (snpndnnn-
carikn). His practice is the ''hoiise-to-hoiise-seekei rs practice/'
7.	v. Eating in one session is "one-session." He has that habit, thus he is a "one-
sessionei." His practice is the "one-sessionei's practice/'
1.	Nibbacana—"derivative name (or verbal derivative)"; grain, term not in PED; M-a I
61,105; Vism XVI.16.
2.	Patati—"to gather (or to wander)": not in PED.
3.	Avakltandana—"hiatus" and dana—"gap": not in PED.
`57
vi. Alins (piudii) in one bowl (pnttn) only because of ref using a second vessel, is
"bowl-alms" (pnttn-piudn). Now, making "bowl alms" (pnttn-piiiiin) the name for
the taking of aims food in the bowl: bowl-alms-tood is his habit, thus he is a "bowl-
tood-eater〃 (imttnpintiikn). His practice is the "bowl-food-eater's practice."
8.	vii. "No〃 (kJiahi) is a particle in the sense of retusing. [61] Food (bhntta) obtained
later by one who has shown that he is satisfied is called "later-food〃 (yncchn-bhnttn).
The eating of that later food is "latei-food-eating." Making "latei’-food〃 (pnccha-
bhntta) the name for that later-food-eatmg: later-food is his habit, thus he is a "latei-
food-[eat-]er〃 (pncchnbhnttika). Not a later-food-eater is a "no-latei-food-[eat-】er〃
(khnlu-pncchnbhnttikn), [that is, a ^later-food-refuserr/]. This is the name for one who
as an undertaking refuses extra food. But it is said in the commentary4 "Khalu is a
certain kind of bird. When it has taken a fniit into its beak and that drops, it does
not eat any more. This [bhikkhu] is like that." Thus he is "a latei -food-r ef user/r
(klinlii-paccha-bhattikn). His practice is the 'latei-food-refuser's practice."
9.	viii. His habit is dwelling in the forest, thus he is a "forest-dwellei,.〃 His practice
is the "torest-dweller's practice/7
ix.	Dwelling at the root of a tree is "h,ee-i,oo卜dwelling." He has that habit, thus
he is a ntree-root-dweller.n The practice of the tree-root-dweller is the "tree-ioot-
dweller's practice."
x.,	xi. Likewise with the open-aii-dweller and the charnel-groiuid-dweller.
10.	xii. Only what has been distributed (ynd eva santhntn) is "as distributed"
(yathasanthntn). This is a term for the resting place first allotted thus "This one falls
to you." He has the habit of dwelling in that as distributed, thus he is an "as-
disti,ibiited-usei'〃 (\/nthasant1intika), [that is, an "any-bed-usei,"]. His practice is the
"any-bed-user's practice."
xiii. He has the habit of keeping to the sitting [posture when resting], retusing
to lie down, thus he is a "sitter." His practice is the "sitter's practice."
11.	All these, however, are the practices (anga) of a bhikkhu who is ascetic (dhutn)
because he has shaken off (dhiita) defilement by tindei taking one 01 other of them.
Or the knowledge that has got the name “ascetic" (dhtitn) because it shakes off
(dltunann) defilement is a practice (anga) belonging to these, thus they are "ascetic
practices" (dJnitnngn). Or alternatively they are ascetic (dlmta) because they shake
off (niddlnuimia) opposition, and they are practices (anga) because they are a way
(patipatti).
This, firstly is how the exposition should be known here as to meaning.
12.	2. All of them have as their characteristic the volition of undertaking. For this
is said [in the conunentaiy]: "He who does the undertaking is a person. That
whereby he does the imdertakmg is states of consciousness and consciousness-
conconiitaiits. The volition of the act of tindei taking is the ascetic practice. What it
rejects is the instance." All have the fiuiction of eliminating cupidity and they
4. Such references to "the Commentary" are to the old Sinhalese coimnentary, no
longer extant, from which Bhadantacariya Buddhaghosa drew his material.
`58
manifest themselves with the production of non-cupidity. For their proximate cause
they have the noble states consisting of fewness of wishes, and so on. [62] This is
how the exposition should be known ns to cJinrncteristic, etc” here.
13.	3. As regards the five beginning with the undertnking and directions: diuing
the Blessed One's lifetime all ascetic practices should be Lmdertaken in the Blessed
One's presence. After his attainment of Nibbana this should be done in the presence
of a principal disciple. When he is not available it should be done in the presence
of one whose cankers are destroyed, of a non-retiuner, of a once-returner, of a
stream-enterer, of one who knows the three Pitakas, of one who knows two of the
Pitakas, of one who knows one of the Pitakas, of one who knows one Collection,5
of a teacher of the Commentaries. When he is not available it should be done in the
presence of an observer of an ascetic practice. When he is not available, then after
one has swept out the shrine terrace they can be imdertaken seated in a reverential
posture as though pronoimcmg them in the Fully Enlightened One's presence.
Also it is permitted to undertake them by oneself.
And here should be told the story of the senior of the two brothers who were
elders at Cetiyapabbata and their fewness of wishes with respect to the ascetic
practices6 (M-a II140).
This, firstly is what applies to all [the practices].
14.	Now, we shall proceed to comment on the imdertakmg, directions, grade,
breach and benefits, of each one [separately].
i. First, the reftise-rng-zuenre/s practice is imdertaken with one of these two
statements: "I refuse robes given by householders" or "I imdertake the refuse-rag-
weai’ei's practice/7 This, firstly is the undertnking.
15.	One who has done this should get a robe of one of the followmg kinds: one
from a charnel groiuid, one from a shop, a cloth from a street, a cloth from a niidden,
one from a childbed, an ablution cloth, a cloth from a washing place, one worn
going to and retiunmg from [the charnel groiuui], one scorched by fiie, one gnawed
by cattle, one gnawed by ants, one gnawed by rats, one cut at the end, one cut at the
edge, one carried as a flag, a robe from a shrine, an ascetic's robe, one from a
consecration, one produced by supernormal power, one from a highway, one borne
by the wind, one presented by deities, one from the sea. Taking one of these robe
cloths, he should tear off and throw away the weak parts, and then wash the soiuid
parts and make up a robe. He can use it after getting rid of his old robe given by
householders.
16.	Herein, “one from a charnel ground" is one dropped on a charnel ground.
5.	one who knows one of the five collections (nikaya) beginning with
the Collection of Long Discourses (Digha Nikaya). (Vism-nilit 76)"
6.	"That elder, it seems, was a sitter, but no one knew it. Then one night the other saw
him by the light of a flash of lightning sitting up on his bed. He asked, 'Are you a sitter,
venerable sir?' Out of fewness of wishes that his ascetic practice should get known, the
elder lay down. Afterwards he imdeitook the practice anew. So the story has come
down. (Vism-nilit 77)"
`59
"Oiie from a shop" is one dropped at the door of a shop.
nA cloth from a street" is a cloth thrown into a street from inside a window by
those who seek merit.
nA clotli from a midden" [63] is a cloth thrown onto a place for rubbish.
“One from a chndbecT is a cloth thrown away after wiping up the stains of
childbirth with it. The mother of Tissa the Minister, it seems, had the stains of
childbirth wiped up with a cloth worth a himdred [pieces], and thinking, "The
refuse-rag wearers will take it,〃 she had it thrown onto the Talaveli Road.7 Bhikkhus
took it for the piupose of mending worn places.
17. ''An ablution cloth" is one that people who are made by devil doctors to bathe
themselves, including their heads, are accustomed to throw away as a "cloth of ill
luck."
nA clot J i from washing plnce/r is rags thrown away at a washing place where bathing
is done.
"Oiie zoom going to mid coming from" is one that people throw away after they
have gone to a charnel groirnd and retiuned and bathed.
"Otie scorched by fire” is one partly scorched by fire; for people throw that away.
"Oiie gnawed by cattle/, etc., are obvious; for people throw away such as these
"Oue carried ns a flagf/: Those who board a ship do so after hoisting a flag. It is
allowable to take this when they have gone out of sight. Also it is allowable, when
the two armies have gone away, to take a flag that has been hoisted on a battlefield.
18.	°A robe from a shrine" is an offering made by draping a terniite-moiuui fin
cloth].
''An ascetic's robe" is one belonging to a bhikkhu.
"One from a consecrationn is one thrown away at the king's consecration place.
"One produced by supernormal power" is a //come-bhikkhii// robe.8 "One from a
highway” is one dropped in the middle of a road. But one dropped by the owner's
negligence should be taken only after waiting a while.
"One borne by the windn is one that falls a long way off, having been carried by
the wind. It is allowable to take it if the owners are not in sight.
"One presented by deities" is one given by deities like that given to the Elder
Aiuiruddlia (Dhp-a II173-74).
"Oiie from the sen” is one washed up on dry land by the sea waves.
19.	One given thus "We give it to the Order" or got by those who go out for alins-
cloth is not a refuse-rag. And in the case of one presented by a bhikkhu, one given
7.	'The name of a street in Mahagama (S.E. Sri Lanka). Also in Anmadl'iapiira, they
say" (Vism-mht 77).
8.	On certain occasions, when the going forth was given by the Buddha with only the
words, "Elii bhikkhu (Come, bhikkhu)," owing to the disciple's past merit robes appealed
miiaciilously upon liim (see e.g. Vin Mahavagga, Kh. 1).
`60
after it has been got fat a presentation of robes by householders] at the end of the|
Rains, or a "resting-place i,obe〃 [that is, one automatically supplied by a householder
to the occupant of a certain resting place] is not a refuse-rag. It is a refuse-rag only
when given after not having been so obtained. And herein, that placed by the donors
at a bhikkhu's feet but given by that bhikkhu to the refuse-rag wearer by placing it
iii his hand is called pure in one way. That given to a bhikkhu by placing it in his
hand but placed by him at the frefuse-rag wearer's] feet is also piue in one way.
That which is both placed at a bhikkhii's feet and then given by him m the same
way is pure in both ways. [64] One obtained by being placed in the hand and
[given by beingl placed in the hand too is not a strict inan's robe. So a refuse-rag
wearer should use the robe after getting to know about the kinds of refuse-rags.
These are the directions for it in this instance.
20.	The grades are these. There are three kinds of refiise-rag wearers: the strict, the
medium, and the mild. Herein, one who takes it only from a charnel groirnd is strict.
One who takes one left fby someone, thinkingl "One gone forth will take it" is mediiun.
One who takes one given bv being placed at his feet fby a bhikkhu] is mild.
The moment anyone of these of his own choice or inclination agrees to [accept]
a robe given by a householder, his ascetic practice is broken. This is the breach in
this instance.
21.	The benefits are these. He actually practices in confoimity with the dependence,
because of the words "The going forth by depending on the refuse-rag robe" (Vin
158,96); he is established in the first of the Noble Ones' heritages (A II27); there is
no suffering due to protecting; he exists independent of others; there is no fear of
robbers; there is no craving connected with use [of robes]; it is a requisite suitable
for an ascetic; it is a requisite recommended by the Blessed One thus "valueless,
easy to get, and blameless" (A II 26); it inspires confidence; it produces the fmits
of fewness of wishes, etc.; the right way is cultivated; a good example is set9 to later
generations.
22.	While striving for Death's aiiny's rout
The ascetic clad in mg-iobe clout
Got from a rubbish heap, shines bright
As mail-clad warrior in the fight.
This robe the world's great teacher wore,
Leaving rare Kasi cloth and more;
Of rags from off a rubbish heap
Who would not have a robe to keep?
Minding the words he did profess
When he went into homelessness,
Let him to wear such rags delight
As one in seemly garb bedight.
This, firstly is the commentary on the imdertaking, directions, grades, breach,
and benefits, in the case of the refuse-rag-wearer's practice.
9. Apmdaiia—"institution (or production),〃 not in PED.
`61
23.	ii. Next there is the triyle-robe-wearers practice. This is undertaken with one
of the following statements: "I refuse a fourth iobe〃 or "I imdertake the triple-
robe-wearer's practice/7 [65]
When a triple-robe wearer has got cloth for a robe, he can put it by for as long
as, owing to ill-health, he is imable to make it up, or for as long as he does not find
a helper, or lacks a needle, etc., and there is no fault in his putting it by. But it is not
allowed to put it by once it has been dyed. That is called cheating the ascetic practice.
These are the directions for it.
24.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict should, at the time ot dyeing,
first dye either the inner cloth or the upper garment, and having dyed it, he should
wear that roimd the waist and dye the other. Then he can put that on over the
shoulder and dye the cloak of patches. But he is not allowed to wear the cloak of
patches roimd the waist. This is the duty when in an abode inside a village. But it
is allowable for him in the forest to wash and dye two together. However, he should
sit iii a place near fto the robes] so that, if he sees anyone, he can pull a yellow cloth
over himself. But for the mediiun one there is a yellow cloth in the dyeing room for
use while dyeing, and it is allowable for him to wear that [as an inner cloth] or to
put it on fas an upper garment] in order to do the work of dyeing. For the mild one
it is allowable to wear, or put on, the robes of bhikkhus who are in coimnimion (i.e.
not suspended, etc.) in order to do the work of dyeing. A bedspread that remains
where it is10 is also allowable for him, but he must not take it about him. And it is
allowed for him to use from time to time the robes of bhikkhus who are in
communion. It is allowed to one who wears the triple robe as an ascetic practice to
have a yellow shoulder-cloth too as a fourth; but it nuist be only a span wide and
three hands long.
The moment anyone of these three agrees to [accept] a fourth robe, his ascetic
practice is broken. This is the breach in this instance.
25.	The benefits are these. The bhikkhu who is a triple-robe wearer is content
with the robe as a protection for the body. Hence he goes taking it with him as a
bird does its wings (M1180); and such special qualities as having few Lmdertakmgs,
avoidance of storage of cloth, a frugal existence, the abandoning of greed for many
robes, living in effacement by observing moderation even in what is permitted,
production of the fruits of fewness of wishes, etc., are perfected. [66]
26.	No risk of hoarding haunts the man of wit
Who wants no extra cloth for requisite;
Using the triple robe where'er he goes
The pleasant relish of content he knows.
10. Tntratthaka-paccattharana—"a bedspread that remains there"; "A name for what
has been determined upon as a bedspread in one's own resting place or in someone
else's. They say accordingly (it is said in a commentary) that there is no breach of the
ascetic practice even when these two, that is, the bedspread and the luuiyed cloth, are
kept as extra lobes" (Vism-nil'it 78-79). For tatratthaka (fixture) see also §61.
`62
So, would the adept wander undeterred
With naught else but his robes, as flies the bird
With its own wings, then let him too rejoice
That frugaliiess m garments be his choice.
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the triple-robe-wearer's practice.
27.	iii. The alms-food-ente/s practice is undertaken with one of the following
statements: "I refuse a supplementaiy [food] supply" 01 "I imdertake the alins-
food-eatei's practice."
Now, this alms-food eater should not accept the following fourteen kinds ot
meal: a meal offered to the Order, a meal offered to specified bhikkhus, an invitation,
a meal given by a ticket, one each half-moon day one each Uposatha day one each
first of the half-moon, a meal given for visitors, a meal for travellers, a meal for the
sick, a meal for sick-iuuses, a meal supplied to a [particular] residence, a meal
given in a principal house,11 a meal given in turn.
If, instead of saying "Take a meal given to the Older", [meals] are given saying
"The Order is taking alms in our house; you may take alms too", it is allowable to
consent. Tickets from the Older that are not for actual food,12 and also a meal
cooked iii a monastery, are allowable as well.
These are the directions for it.
28.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict takes alms brought both
from before and from behind, and he gives the bowl to those who take it while he
stands outside a door. He also takes alms brought to the refectory and given there.
But he does not take alms by sitting [and waiting for it to be brought later] that day.
The medium one takes it as well by sitting [and waiting for it to be brought later]
that day; but he does not consent to fits being brought] the next day. The mild one
consents to aims [being brought] on the next day and on the day after. Both these
last miss the joy of an independent life. There is, perhaps, a preaching on the Noble
Ones' heritages (A II 28) in some village. The strict one says to the others "Let us
go, friends, and listen to the Dhamma." One of them says, "I have been made to sit
[and wait] by a man, venerable sir, and the other, "I have consented to [receive]
alms tomorrow, venerable sir." So they are both losers. The other wanders for alms
iii the morning and then he goes and savours the taste of the Dhamma. [67]
The moment anyone of these three agrees to the extra gain consisting of a meal
given to the Order, etc., his ascetic practice is broken. This is the breach in this
instance.
29. The benefits are these. He actually practices in conformity with the dependence
because of the words "The going forth by depending on the eating of lumps of
11.	"A meal to be given by setting it out in a piiiicipal house only." (Vism-nilit 79)
This meaning of dhurn-bhatta not in PED.
12.	"Tickets that are not for actual food, but deal with medicine, etc." (Vism-mlit 79)

`63
aims food" (Vin II 58, 96); he is established in the second of the Noble Ones'
heritages; his existence is independent of others; it is a requisite reconunended by
the Blessed One thus "Valueless, easy to get, blameless" (A II 26); idleness is
eliminated; livelihood is purified; the practice of the minor traii'iiiig rule [of the
Patimokkha] is fulfilled; he is not maintained by another; he helps others; pride is
abandoned; craving for tastes is checked; the haining precepts about eating as a
group, substituting one meal [invitation for another] (see Vinaya, Pacittiya 33 and
Corny.), and good behavioiu*, are not contravened; his life conforms to [the principles
of| fewness of wishes; he cultivates the right way; he has compassion for later
generations.
30.	The monk content with aims for food
Has independent livelihood,
And greed in him no footing finds;
He is as free as the four winds.
He never need be indolent,
His livelihood is innocent,
So let a wise man not disdain
Alins-gatheriiig for his domain.
Since it is said:
"If a bhikklui can support himself on alms
And live without another's maintenance,
And pay no heed as well to gam and fame,
The very gods indeed might envy him" (Ud 31).
This is the commentary on the undertaking, directions, grades, breach and
benefits, in the case of the alms-food-eater's practice.
31.	iv. The hoiise-to-hoiise seeker,s practice is undertaken with one of the followmg
statements "I refuse a greedy alms l’otind" or "I Luuiertake the house-to-house
seeker's practice/'
Now, the house-to-house seeker should stop at the village gate and make sure
that there is no danger. If there is danger in any street 01 village, it is allowable to
leave it out and wander for alins elsewhere. When there is a house door 01 a street
or a village where he [regularly] gets nothing at all, he can go [past it] not counting
it as a village. But wherever he gets anything at all it is not allowed [subsequently]
to go [past] there and leave it out. This bhikkhu should enter the village early so
that he will be able to leave out any inconvenient place and go elsewhere. [68] But
if people who are giving a gift [of a ineal] in a monastery or who are coming along
the road take his bowl and give alms food, it is allowable. And as this [bhikkhu] is
going along the road, he should, when it is the time, wander for alms in any village
he comes to and not pass it by. If he gets nothing there or only a little, he should
wander for alins in the next village in order. These are the directions for it.
32.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict does not take aims brought
from before 01 brought from behind 01 brought to the refectory and given there.
He hands over his bowl at a door, however; for in this ascetic practice there is none
equal to the Elder Malia Kassapa, yet an instance in which even he handed over his
`64
bowl is mentioned (see Ud 29). The medium one takes what is brought from before
and from behind and what is brought to the refectory and he hands over his bowl
at a door. But he does not sit waiting for alms. Thus he conforms to the rule of the
strict alms-food eater. The mild one sits waiting [foi alms to be brought] that day.
The ascetic practice of these three is broken as soon as the greedy alms round
starts [by going only to the houses where good alms food is given]. This is the
breach in this instance.
33.	The benefits are these. He is always a stranger among families and is like the
moon (SII197); he abandons avarice about families; he is compassionate impartially;
he avoids the dangers in being supported by a family； he does not delight in
invitations; he does not hope for [meals] to be brought; his life conforms to [the
principles of] fewness of wishes, and so on.
34.	The monk who at each house his begging plies
Is moonlike, ever new to families,
Nor does he grudge to help all equally
Free from the risks of house-dependency.
Who would the self-indulgent round forsake
And roam the world at will, the while to make
His downcast eyes range a yoke-length before,
Then let him wisely seek from door to door.
This is the commentary on the imdertakmg, directions, grades, breach, and
benefits, in the case of the house-to-house-seeker's practice. [69]
35.	v. The one-sessioner s practice is undertaken with one of the followmg statements:
"I refuse eating in several sessions" or "I imdertake the one-sessioner's practice."
When the one-sessioner sits down in the sitting hall, instead of sitting on an
elder's seat, he should notice which seat is likely to fall to him and sit down on
that. If his teacher or preceptor arrives while the meal is still imfiiiished, it is
allowable for him to get up and do the duties. But the Elder Tipitaka Cilia-Abhaya
said: "He should either keep his seat [and finish his meal] or [if he gets up he
should leave the rest of] his meal [in order not to break the ascetic practice]. And
this is one whose meal is still unfinished; therefore let him do the duties, but in
that case let him not eat the [rest of the] meal." These are the directions.
36.	This too has three grades. Herein, one who is strict may not take anything
more than the food that he has laid his hand on whether it is little 01 much. And if
people bring him ghee, etc., thinking "The elder has eaten nothing," while these
are allowable for the purpose of medicine, they are not so for the purpose of food.
The medium one may take more as long as the meal in the bowl is not exhausted;
for he is called "one who stops when the food is finished." The niild one may eat
as long as he does not get lip from his seat. He is either "one who stops with the
water" because he eats until he takes [water foi] washing the bowl, or "one who
stops with the session" because he eats imtil he gets up.
The ascetic practice of these three is broken at the moment when food has been
eaten at more than one session. This is the breach in this instance.
